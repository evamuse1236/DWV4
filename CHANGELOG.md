# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Vision Board: rename areas (name + emoji) via pencil icon on hover in the FAB menu
- Vision Board: delete areas with two-step confirmation showing card count; cascade-deletes all cards in the area
- Active filter resets to "All Goals" when the currently-filtered area is deleted

### Fixed
- DeepWork page background color mismatch with sidebar — removed page-specific watercolor blobs that created a visible yellowish rectangle not extending into the sidebar; the body's ambient blobs now provide a seamless atmosphere across all pages
