# Project Notes (Legacy Compatibility)

This file remains only for tool compatibility.

Active operational and architecture guidance now lives in:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/CORE.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`

Claude-specific workflows are retired for this repository.
For UI ideation, use Gemini CLI in advisory mode and implement changes locally.
