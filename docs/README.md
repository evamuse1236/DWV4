# Documentation Hub

Last updated: 2026-02-17

Goal: minimal overlap, deterministic read order, and clear ownership so humans and AI agents can execute reliably.

## Read Order

1. `docs/CORE.md`
2. `docs/CODEBASE-MAP.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`
5. `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
6. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
7. `docs/AI-SYSTEM.md` (only for AI feature changes)

## Specialized Docs

- Curriculum: `docs/curriculum/README.md`
- Test planning: `docs/reference/README.md`
- Historical context: `docs/archive/README.md`

## Ownership Rules

- Product intent and invariants: `CORE.md`
- File and route map: `CODEBASE-MAP.md`
- Design decisions: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Data contracts: `DATA-MODEL.md`
- Deploy and operations: `RUNBOOK.md`
- Local dev workflow: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- AI prompts/contracts/providers: `AI-SYSTEM.md`

If a new doc overlaps an owner doc, update the owner doc instead.
