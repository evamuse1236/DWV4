# Archive Docs

This folder stores historical, superseded, or overlap-prone docs.

Archive docs are useful for context, but are not implementation source-of-truth.

Current source-of-truth docs are:
- `docs/CORE.md`
- `docs/CODEBASE-MAP.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/AI-SYSTEM.md`

Use archive docs for:
- historical decisions
- retired walkthroughs
- prior codemap snapshots
