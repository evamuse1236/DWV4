# Common Core (CCSS) Grade 6 — Math taxonomy reference

This repo’s Math curriculum is being realigned using **CCSS Grade 6** as the organizing guide.

Source reference (official PDF):

- `https://corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Math_Standards1.pdf` (see Grade 6 section)

This document intentionally **does not reproduce the full standard text**; it records the *taxonomy* (domains → clusters → standard codes) so we can:

- unify chapter structure (no more “two Fractions chapters” ambiguity),
- right-size objective granularity to match available activity granularity,
- tag objectives/activities for coverage and validation.

## Domains (Grade 6)

### 6.RP — Ratios and Proportional Relationships

Cluster: **Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems**

- `6.RP.1` Ratio concept + ratio language
- `6.RP.2` Unit rate concept + rate language
- `6.RP.3` Solve ratio/rate problems (tables/diagrams/equations)
  - `6.RP.3a` Equivalent ratio tables + plot pairs
  - `6.RP.3b` Unit rate problems (pricing, constant speed)
  - `6.RP.3c` Percents as “per 100”; find whole/part given percent
  - `6.RP.3d` Convert measurement units with ratio reasoning

### 6.NS — The Number System

Cluster: **Divide fractions by fractions**

- `6.NS.1` Interpret/compute fraction ÷ fraction (models + equations)

Cluster: **Compute fluently with multi-digit numbers; factors/multiples**

- `6.NS.2` Fluently divide multi-digit numbers (standard algorithm)
- `6.NS.3` Fluently operate on multi-digit decimals (standard algorithms)
- `6.NS.4` GCF/LCM (within stated bounds); distributive factoring as expression

Cluster: **Apply/extend to rational numbers**

- `6.NS.5` Positive/negative quantities in context; meaning of 0
- `6.NS.6` Rational numbers on number line/coordinate plane (incl. opposites)
  - `6.NS.6a` Opposites on number line; 0 is its own opposite
  - `6.NS.6b` Signs in ordered pairs; reflections across axes
  - `6.NS.6c` Locate rational numbers on number lines and planes
- `6.NS.7` Ordering and absolute value of rational numbers
  - `6.NS.7a` Inequalities as relative position on number line
  - `6.NS.7b` Order statements in real-world contexts
  - `6.NS.7c` Absolute value as distance from 0; magnitude in context
  - `6.NS.7d` Distinguish order vs absolute value comparisons
- `6.NS.8` Graph points in all four quadrants; use coordinates/absolute value for distances (aligned axes)

### 6.EE — Expressions and Equations

Cluster: **Arithmetic → algebraic expressions**

- `6.EE.1` Numerical expressions with whole-number exponents
- `6.EE.2` Write/read/evaluate expressions with letters (interpret parts, evaluate at values)
- `6.EE.3` Use properties to generate equivalent expressions
- `6.EE.4` Decide when two expressions are equivalent

Cluster: **One-variable equations and inequalities**

- `6.EE.5` Equation/inequality solutions via substitution from a set
- `6.EE.6` Use variables to represent unknowns / sets; write expressions in problems
- `6.EE.7` Solve `x + p = q` and `px = q` (nonnegative rational numbers)
- `6.EE.8` Inequalities `x > c` / `x < c`; represent solution sets on number line

Cluster: **Dependent vs independent variables**

- `6.EE.9` Two-quantity relationships; write equation; analyze via tables/graphs

### 6.G — Geometry

Cluster: **Area, surface area, and volume**

- `6.G.1` Area of triangles/quadrilaterals/polygons via composition/decomposition
- `6.G.2` Volume of right rectangular prisms (incl. fractional edges)
- `6.G.3` Coordinate geometry: polygons from coordinates; side lengths for aligned points
- `6.G.4` Nets for 3D figures; surface area via nets

### 6.SP — Statistics and Probability

Cluster: **Statistical variability**

- `6.SP.1` Identify statistical questions (expect variability)
- `6.SP.2` Understand distributions (center, spread, overall shape)
- `6.SP.3` Measures of center vs variation (role and meaning)

Cluster: **Summarize and describe distributions**

- `6.SP.4` Display numerical data (dot plots, histograms, box plots)
- `6.SP.5` Summarize data in context (N, attribute, center/variability, relate measures to distribution shape)
