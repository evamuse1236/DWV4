# Trust Jar Plan

## Purpose
Keep two trust jars fully separate so that marbles earned by one batch are never mixed with the other batch. The two batches are 2153 and 2156, and marbles are earned collectively within each batch only.

## Batches
- Batch 2153
- Batch 2156

## Separation Principles
- Two jars, two logs, two owners.
- No transfers between jars for any reason.
- Every action must identify the batch before marbles are added or removed.

## Physical Setup
- Use two clearly labeled jars:
  - "Trust Jar - Batch 2153"
  - "Trust Jar - Batch 2156"
- Use distinct visual cues to prevent mix-ups:
  - Different colored lids or labels.
  - Different jar shapes or sizes if available.
- Store jars in separate, labeled locations (not side-by-side if avoidable).
- Keep a simple color key posted near storage:
  - 2153 = Blue
  - 2156 = Green

## Earning Marbles (Add Process)
1. Confirm the batch number before awarding marbles.
2. State the batch aloud and show the correct jar.
3. Add marbles only to that batch's jar.
4. Record the action in that batch's log.

If the same event applies to both batches:
- Record it twice (once per batch), and add marbles separately to each jar.

## Redemption (Remove Process)
1. Confirm the batch number requesting redemption.
2. Verify the jar and log match the batch.
3. Remove marbles only from that batch's jar.
4. Record the action in that batch's log.

## Logging and Records
Maintain two separate logs (paper or digital), one per batch. Each entry must include:
- Date
- Batch ID (2153 or 2156)
- Action (add or remove)
- Marble count
- Reason / activity
- Staff initials

## Admin Page (Digital Entry)
If marbles are added or removed through the admin page:
- Require the teacher to select a batch before entering a marble count.
- Show the selected batch prominently on the entry form and confirmation step.
- Keep separate totals for 2153 and 2156 and never merge them.
- Write each entry to the matching batch log with the teacher's name and timestamp.
- Add a confirmation prompt for removals to prevent accidental cross-batch changes.

## Ownership and Access
- Assign a primary staff owner for each jar and log.
- If a substitute handles a jar, they must sign the log.
- Only authorized staff can add or remove marbles.

## Error Handling
If a marble is placed in the wrong jar:
- Correct immediately.
- Record a correction entry in both logs (remove from wrong jar, add to correct jar).
- Note the reason for correction.

If the batch is uncertain:
- Pause the action.
- Confirm the batch first, then proceed.

## Audit Checks
- Weekly: reconcile each jar count to its log.
- Monthly: review for confusion points and update labels or storage as needed.

## Communication to Kids
- Explain that each batch earns and uses its own marbles.
- Reinforce the separation rule during awards and redemptions.
- Use visual cues (color/label) so kids can self-check the correct jar.
