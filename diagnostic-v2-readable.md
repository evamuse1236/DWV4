### Standard 5.NBT.5 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nbt5_mult4x1_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 3,748 × 7?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 25,936 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied, but you forgot to add a carry into the next place. In the standard algorithm, each carry must be added to the next digit’s product.
- B. 26,236 [CORRECT]
- C. 26,136 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You carried the wrong number from a step. Check the tens step: 4×7=28 plus the carry makes 33, so the carry should be 3.
- D. 8,236 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied 748×7, but you didn’t multiply the thousands digit (3,000) by 7. Every digit in 3,748 must be multiplied by 7.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 26,236

**Explanation:** Multiply right to left: 8×7=56 (write 6, carry 5), 4×7+5=33 (write 3, carry 3), 7×7+3=52 (write 2, carry 5), 3×7+5=26. The product is 26,236.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nbt5_secondrow_shift_001

**Prompt:** You are using the standard algorithm to multiply 36 × 25. The first partial product (36 × 5) is 180. What should the second row (for the 2 in 25) be?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 720 [CORRECT]
- B. 72 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the 2 in 25 as 2 ones instead of 2 tens, so you didn’t shift left. The second row should start in the tens place.
- C. 360 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added a zero because it’s a tens row, but you didn’t multiply by 2 first. You must do 36×2, then place it in the tens row.
- D. 7,200 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You shifted the second row too far, as if the 2 meant 200. The 2 in 25 represents 20, so you shift one place, not two.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 720

**Explanation:** The 2 in 25 means 20. Compute 36×2=72, then shift one place left (×10) to get 720.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nbt5_forgot_shift_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 27 × 14?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 135 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found both partial products but added them without shifting the tens row. The row for the ‘1’ in 14 represents 10, so it must be one place to the left.
- B. 2,808 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You shifted the tens row two places, as if the 1 in 14 meant 100. It actually means 10, so you shift only one place.
- C. 378 [CORRECT]
- D. 358 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You made a carry mistake while multiplying 27×4 (you didn’t add the carry to the next step). Recheck 7×4=28, then 2×4 should include the carried 2.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 378

**Explanation:** Compute 27×4=108 and 27×10=270, then add 108+270=378. That’s the standard algorithm result.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nbt5_carry_placevalue_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 2,316 × 4?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9,264 [CORRECT]
- B. 9,244 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You forgot to add the carry from 6×4=24 into the tens step. The carry must be added to 1×4.
- C. 9,444 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the carry to the wrong place value (hundreds instead of tens). Carries always move to the next place to the left immediately.
- D. 92,640 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied by 40 instead of 4 by adding an extra zero. Make sure you’re multiplying by 4 (ones), not 40 (tens).

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 9,264

**Explanation:** 6×4=24 (write 4, carry 2), 1×4+2=6, 3×4=12 (write 2, carry 1), 2×4+1=9. The product is 9,264.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nbt5_zeros_alignment_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 2,030 × 40?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8,120 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied by 4 but forgot that 40 is ten times bigger than 4. Your final answer should be shifted one place left (one extra zero).
- B. 81,200 [CORRECT]
- C. 9,200 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You dropped the zero in 2,030 and treated it like 230. The zero in the middle still changes place value and must be included.
- D. 812,000 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added one extra zero, treating 40 like 400. Since 40 has one zero, you shift one place, not two.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 81,200

**Explanation:** First do 2,030×4=8,120. Because 40=4×10, shift one place left (add one zero): 81,200.

## Module 2: The World of Fractions - Addition & Subtraction

- Topic ID: 2.2
- Power standards: 5.NF.1, 5.NF.2
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NF.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with like denominators.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nf1_001

**Prompt:** Find 2/5 + 1/3 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the numerators and added the denominators. That changes the size of the pieces, so it doesn’t keep the fractions fair to add.
- B. 11/15 [CORRECT]
- C. 3/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the numerators but kept one denominator. You can only add numerators when the denominators (piece sizes) match.
- D. 7/15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You tried to use a common denominator but changed the denominator without changing the numerator the same way. When the denominator is multiplied, the numerator must be multiplied too.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 11/15

**Explanation:** Use a common denominator of 15. Rename: 2/5 = 6/15 and 1/3 = 5/15, then add: 6/15 + 5/15 = 11/15.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nf1_002

**Prompt:** Find 5/6 − 1/4 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted straight across in both numerator and denominator. Denominators tell the size of the parts, so you can’t subtract them like that.
- B. 7/12 [CORRECT]
- C. 2/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted the numerators but kept the denominator 6. That only works when the fractions already have the same denominator.
- D. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used 12 as a common denominator but didn’t change 1/4 correctly. If 1/4 becomes twelfths, it must be 3/12, not 1/12.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7/12

**Explanation:** Use a common denominator of 12. Rename: 5/6 = 10/12 and 1/4 = 3/12, then subtract: 10/12 − 3/12 = 7/12.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nf1_003

**Prompt:** Find 1 2/3 + 2 3/4 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 5/7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the numerators and denominators of the fractional parts (2/3 + 3/4). For unlike denominators, you must rename to like denominators first.
- B. 4 5/12 [CORRECT]
- C. 3 11/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common denominator but changed one fraction without changing its numerator the same way. Renaming must keep the fraction’s value the same.
- D. 4 17/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You stopped after adding and left the fractional part as an improper fraction. The problem asks for simplest form, so you should regroup 17/12 as 1 5/12.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4 5/12

**Explanation:** Add whole numbers and rename the fractions to twelfths: 2/3 = 8/12 and 3/4 = 9/12. Then 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12 = 1 5/12, so the total is 4 5/12.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nf1_004

**Prompt:** Find 3 1/6 − 1 5/8 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 13/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You borrowed for the fractions but forgot to reduce the whole-number part before subtracting. Borrowing 1 whole means the top whole number goes down by 1.
- B. 1 13/24 [CORRECT]
- C. 2 11/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted the fractions in the wrong order instead of borrowing (you did 5/8 − 1/6). In subtraction, you must keep the order and borrow when needed.
- D. 1 1/7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose a ‘common denominator’ by adding denominators (6+8=14). A common denominator must be a common multiple, like 24 for sixths and eighths.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1 13/24

**Explanation:** Since 1/6 is smaller than 5/8, borrow 1: 3 1/6 = 2 7/6. Rename to twenty-fourths: 7/6 = 28/24 and 5/8 = 15/24, so 28/24 − 15/24 = 13/24; and 2 − 1 = 1, giving 1 13/24.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nf1_005

**Prompt:** You want to solve 2/3 + 5/6. What is the correct first step?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Add the denominators to get 9, then rewrite both fractions with denominator 9. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used 3+6 as the common denominator. A common denominator must be a common multiple of both denominators, not their sum.
- B. Rewrite 2/3 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 (so both fractions have like denominators). [CORRECT]
- C. Add numerators and denominators: (2+5)/(3+6). [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You’re combining denominators like they are numbers you can add, but denominators represent piece size. You must make the piece sizes the same first.
- D. Change 2/3 into 2/6 by changing only the denominator to match 6. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You changed the denominator without changing the numerator the same way. When you rename a fraction, you must multiply numerator and denominator by the same number to keep its value.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Rewrite 2/3 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 (so both fractions have like denominators).

**Explanation:** The denominators must match before adding. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, rename 2/3 as 4/6 (multiply top and bottom by 2), then you can add the sixths.

### Standard 5.NF.2 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole, including cases of unlike denominators, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem. Use benchmark fractions and number sense of fractions to estimate mentally and assess the reasonableness of answers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nf2_001

**Prompt:** Mina walked 1/4 mile in the morning and 2/3 mile in the afternoon. How far did she walk in all?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/7 mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added numerators and denominators directly.
- B. 11/12 mile [CORRECT]
- C. 5/7 mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used an incorrect common denominator.
- D. 1 5/6 miles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added with denominator confusion and overestimated.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 11/12 mile

**Explanation:** Use twelfths: 1/4 = 3/12 and 2/3 = 8/12. Sum is 11/12 mile.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nf2_002

**Prompt:** A ribbon was 7/8 meter long. 1/3 meter was used. How much ribbon is left?

  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted denominators and got an invalid setup.
- B. 11/24 meter [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You may have subtracted in the wrong order.
- C. 13/24 meter [CORRECT]
- D. 2/5 meter [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You changed denominators without equivalent fractions.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 13/24 meter

**Explanation:** Use twenty-fourths: 7/8 = 21/24 and 1/3 = 8/24. Difference is 13/24 meter.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nf2_003

**Prompt:** Estimate first: 5/6 + 7/10 is closest to which whole number?

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nf4_whole_times_fraction_improper_001

**Prompt:** Compute 8 × 3/5. Give your answer as an improper fraction in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8 3/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added instead of multiplying. In fraction multiplication, you scale the fraction by the whole number (8 groups of 3/5).
- B. 24/5 [CORRECT]
- C. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied the numerator but forgot the denominator still matters. The 5 stays as the denominator because you are taking fifths.
- D. 3/40 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You changed only the denominator as if you were splitting 3/5 into 8 parts. Multiplying by 8 means making 8 copies, so the numerator must change too.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24/5

**Explanation:** Write 8 as 8/1. Multiply across: (8×3)/(1×5) = 24/5, which is already in simplest form.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nf4_fraction_times_whole_mixed_001

**Prompt:** Compute 5/4 × 6. Write your answer as a mixed number in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added 6 + 5/4 instead of multiplying. The problem is asking for 6 groups of 5/4, not a sum.
- B. 7 1/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 15/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied correctly but didn’t follow the instruction to write a mixed number. Convert 15/2 to a mixed number.
- D. 5/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the multiplication like dividing or like making the fraction smaller. Multiplying by 6 should make the amount larger here.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7 1/2

**Explanation:** Multiply: (5×6)/4 = 30/4 = 15/2. Convert 15/2 to a mixed number: 7 1/2.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nf4_fraction_times_fraction_simplify_001

**Prompt:** Compute 6/9 × 3/4. Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 18/36 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied correctly but stopped before simplifying. 18/36 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 18.
- B. 1/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used a wrong rule like adding numerators while multiplying denominators. In multiplication, you must multiply both numerators and both denominators.
- D. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied the numerators but forgot to multiply the denominators. In fraction multiplication, both parts change: (6×3)/(9×4).

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/2

## Module 3: Decimals - Decimal Concepts & Operations

- Topic ID: 3.1
- Power standards: 5.NBT.7
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NBT.7 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nbt7_add_align_001

**Prompt:** Compute 7.08 + 2.90.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9.08 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added only the whole numbers and kept the .08. You also need to add the tenths and hundredths from 2.90.
- B. 9.98 [CORRECT]
- C. 7.37 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You lined up digits instead of lining up the decimal points, so 2.90 acted like 0.29. Always align the decimal points first.
- D. 9.17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed the 9 from 2.9 into the hundredths place (like 2.09). But 2.9 means 2.90, so the 9 is in the tenths place.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 9.98

**Explanation:** Line up decimal points: 7.08 + 2.90. Add hundredths and tenths: 0.08 + 0.90 = 0.98, and 7 + 2 = 9, so the sum is 9.98.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nbt7_sub_borrow_001

**Prompt:** Compute 5.00 − 2.67.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3.67 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted the whole numbers and then kept 0.67 instead of borrowing. Because 0.00 is smaller than 0.67, you must borrow across the decimal.
- B. 2.33 [CORRECT]
- C. 2.43 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You borrowed from 5.00 but didn’t adjust the tenths correctly after borrowing to the hundredths. After borrowing 1 tenth to make 10 hundredths, the tenths should be 9, not 10.
- D. 2.93 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 2.67 like it was 2.067 by misaligning the digits. In subtraction, the decimal points must line up so tenths subtract from tenths and hundredths from hundredths.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 2.33

**Explanation:** Rename 5.00 as 4.100, then as 4.99 with 10 hundredths available: 10−7=3 hundredths, 9−6=3 tenths, and 4−2=2. The difference is 2.33.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nbt7_mult_dec_whole_001

**Prompt:** Compute 4.75 × 6.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2850 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You ignored the decimal point and multiplied 475 × 6. The digits are right, but the decimal value must stay correct: 4.75 is less than 5, so the product can’t be in the thousands.
- B. 28.50 [CORRECT]
- C. 10.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added instead of multiplying. Multiplication means 6 groups of 4.75, not 4.75 + 6.
- D. 24.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied only the whole-number part (4×6) and left the .75 unchanged. The decimal part is also multiplied by 6.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 28.50

**Explanation:** Multiply as whole numbers: 475 × 6 = 2850, then place the decimal two places (because 4.75 has two decimal places): 28.50.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nbt7_mult_dec_dec_001

**Prompt:** Compute 0.25 × 0.40.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed the decimal too far to the right by not counting all the decimal places. The product of two decimals less than 1 should be less than 1.
- B. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You counted too few decimal places in the product. Since both factors are less than 1, the product should be smaller than each factor, not equal to 1.
- C. 0.10 [CORRECT]
- D. 0.01 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed the decimal too far to the left (too many decimal places). Count the total decimal places in both factors to place the decimal correctly.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 0.10

**Explanation:** Multiply 25 × 40 = 1000. There are 4 decimal places total (two in 0.25 and two in 0.40), so the product is 0.1000 = 0.10.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nbt7_div_dec_dec_001

**Prompt:** Compute 0.63 ÷ 0.09.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.07 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You moved the decimal in the divisor (0.09 → 9) but didn’t move the decimal in the dividend the same way. If you multiply the divisor by 100, you must multiply the dividend by 100 too.
- B. 7 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 0.09 like 9 and also shifted the dividend only a little. When you make 0.09 into 9, you have to shift the dividend the same number of places.
- D. 700 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You moved the decimal in the dividend (0.63 → 63) but didn’t move the divisor to match. In decimal division, you must scale both numbers by the same power of 10.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7

**Explanation:** Make the divisor a whole number by multiplying both numbers by 100: 0.63 ÷ 0.09 = 63 ÷ 9 = 7.

  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely chose 8 instead of 9 for 37 ÷ 4, and then you also dropped a digit when the next part was 52 ÷ 4 = 13. In long division, each step must use the biggest whole number that still fits.
- B. 93 [CORRECT]
- C. 90 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You brought down the 2 without combining it with the remainder. After 37 − 36 = 1, the next number is 12 (not 2).
- D. 98 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You made a subtraction mistake after multiplying. If 9 × 4 = 36, then 37 − 36 should leave a remainder of 1, not 3.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 93

**Explanation:** 4 goes into 37 nine times (9×4=36), leaving remainder 1. Bring down the 2 to make 12, and 12÷4=3, so the quotient is 93.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns2_002

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 4024 ÷ 4.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 106 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You forgot to place a 0 in the quotient when you reached a place where 4 went in 0 times. Zeros in the quotient are important placeholders for place value.
- B. 1006 [CORRECT]
- C. 101 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely skipped a digit when bringing down numbers. In long division you must bring down digits one at a time, in order.
- D. 1001 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the last step like it was 4 ÷ 4 instead of 24 ÷ 4. When you bring down the last digit, you divide the whole new number you formed (24), not just the final digit.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1006

**Explanation:** 4÷4=1, then bring down 0 so 0÷4=0, then bring down 2 so 2÷4=0 remainder 2, then bring down 4 to make 24 and 24÷4=6. The quotient is 1006.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns2_003

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 1512 ÷ 24.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 60 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found 24 goes into 151 about 6 times, but then you didn’t use the remainder to make 72. After subtracting, you must bring down the next digit and divide the new number.
- B. 63 [CORRECT]
- C. 61 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely subtracted wrong after 6×24=144. If 151−144 is not correct, the next number you form after bringing down 2 will also be wrong.
- D. 66 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You made a division fact mistake with 72 ÷ 24. Since 24×3=72, the next quotient digit should be 3, not 6.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 63

**Explanation:** 24 goes into 151 six times (6×24=144), leaving 7. Bring down 2 to make 72, and 72÷24=3, so the quotient is 63.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns2_004

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 1237 ÷ 5. Give the quotient with remainder.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 247 R0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the final remainder as 0, which usually comes from a subtraction mistake at the end. Since 5×7=35, 37−35 should leave 2, not 0.
- B. 247 R2 [CORRECT]
- C. 254 R3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You brought down digits in the wrong order or skipped a step. In long division, you must bring down the next digit one at a time (first the 3, then the 7).
- D. 247.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You converted the remainder into a decimal even though the problem asked for a remainder. Here you should stop after the remainder and write it as R2.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 247 R2

**Explanation:** 12÷5=2 remainder 2; bring down 3 to make 23, so 23÷5=4 remainder 3; bring down 7 to make 37, so 37÷5=7 remainder 2. The result is 247 R2.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns2_005

**Prompt:** A student used long division for 306 ÷ 3 and wrote 12. Which answer is the correct quotient?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You forgot to write a 0 in the quotient when you reached the 0 in 306. Even if 3 goes into 0 zero times, you still need the 0 as a placeholder.
- B. 102 [CORRECT]
- C. 112 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You brought down two digits at once (making 36) instead of dividing the 0 place first. In long division, you must bring down one digit at a time to keep place value correct.
- D. 100 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You stopped too early and didn’t divide the last digit. After you handle 30, you still need to bring down and divide the 6.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 102

**Explanation:** 3 goes into 3 once, then bring down 0 so 0÷3=0, then bring down 6 so 6÷3=2. The correct quotient is 102.

## Module 1: Whole Number Foundations - Number Theory (Factors & Multiples)

- Topic ID: 1.3
- Power standards: 6.NS.4
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.NS.4 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers less than or equal to 12. Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns4_gcf_swap_small_001

**Prompt:** What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 48?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common factor, but you stopped too early. Both numbers are divisible by 12, which is greater than 6.
- B. 12 [CORRECT]
- C. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose a factor of 48 but didn’t check 36. A GCF must divide both numbers exactly.
- D. 144 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common multiple (actually the LCM), not a common factor. The GCF must be a number that goes into both 36 and 48.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 12

**Explanation:** Prime factorize: 36 = 2×2×3×3 and 48 = 2×2×2×2×3. The shared factors are 2×2×3 = 12, so the GCF is 12.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns4_gcf_002

**Prompt:** What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 28 and 42?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You noticed both numbers are even and stopped at 2. Keep checking—there is a larger number that divides both.
- B. 14 [CORRECT]
- C. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common factor, but it is not the greatest. Since both numbers are also divisible by 14, 7 can’t be the GCF.
- D. 84 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common multiple (the LCM), not a common factor. The GCF must be smaller than or equal to both numbers and divide both.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 14

**Explanation:** List factors: 28 has factors 1,2,4,7,14,28 and 42 has factors 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. The greatest shared factor is 14.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns4_lcm_swap_001

**Prompt:** What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You gave the greatest common factor instead of the least common multiple. LCM is a number both 6 and 8 can multiply to make.
- B. 24 [CORRECT]
- C. 48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied 6×8, but the LCM is not always the product. Since 6 and 8 share a factor (2), the LCM is smaller than 48.
- D. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You may have listed multiples of 6 and stopped too soon. 12 is not a multiple of 8, so it can’t be the LCM.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24

**Explanation:** Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24… Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24… The first match is 24, so the LCM is 24.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns4_lcm_002

**Prompt:** What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found a common factor (GCF), not a common multiple. LCM must be a number that both 9 and 12 go into.
- B. 36 [CORRECT]
- C. 108 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used 9×12, but the LCM is not always the product. Because 9 and 12 share a factor (3), the LCM is smaller than 108.
- D. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You picked a multiple of 12 but didn’t check 9. 24 is not divisible by 9, so it can’t be a common multiple.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 36

**Explanation:** Multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36… Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36… The first match is 36, so the LCM is 36.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns4_distributive_factor_001

**Prompt:** Which expression uses the distributive property to rewrite 36 + 24 by factoring out the greatest common factor?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4(9 + 6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You factored out a common factor, but not the greatest one. Since 9 and 6 still share a factor (3), you can factor more.
- B. 12(3 + 2) [CORRECT]
- C. 12(3 + 24) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided only 36 by 12, but you must divide both addends. When you factor out 12, 24 must become 2, not stay 24.
- D. 12(36 + 24) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You pulled out 12 but didn’t change the numbers inside the parentheses. Factoring means each addend is rewritten as 12 times a smaller number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 12(3 + 2)

**Explanation:** The GCF of 36 and 24 is 12. Rewrite 36 as 12×3 and 24 as 12×2, so 36 + 24 = 12(3 + 2).

## Module 2: The World of Fractions - Multiplication & Division

- Topic ID: 2.3
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.NS.1

### Standard 6.NS.1 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns1_fraction_div_001

**Prompt:** Compute (5/8 ÷ 3/4). Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 15/32 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied instead of dividing. For division, you should multiply by the reciprocal of 3/4, not multiply the fractions as-is.
- B. 1/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided "top by top" and "bottom by bottom" using whole-number thinking (like 5÷3=1). That changes the fractions and doesn't represent the real quotient.
- C. 6/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You inverted the wrong fraction. Only the divisor (3/4) should be flipped, not (5/8).
- D. 5/6 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 5/6

**Explanation:** Multiply by the reciprocal: 5/8 ÷ 3/4 = 5/8 × 4/3 = 20/24 = 5/6.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns1_mixed_div_fraction_001

**Prompt:** Compute (3 1/2 ÷ 1/4). Give your answer as a whole number.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied instead of dividing. Dividing by 1/4 should make the result larger, not smaller.
- B. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You ignored the 1/2 and used only 3. The mixed number 3 1/2 must be treated as one value.
- C. 28 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You set it up correctly but forgot to divide by 2 after multiplying: 7/2 × 4 = 28/2, not 28.
- D. 14 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 14

**Explanation:** Convert 3 1/2 = 7/2. Then 7/2 ÷ 1/4 = 7/2 × 4 = 28/2 = 14.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns1_fraction_div_whole_001

**Prompt:** Compute (3/4 ÷ 6). Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied by 6 instead of dividing. Dividing by 6 should make the result smaller than 3/4.
- B. 1/6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You set up 3/24 but simplified incorrectly. When you divide 3 and 24 by 3, you get 1/8, not 1/6.
- C. 2/9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You inverted the wrong number. You flipped 3/4 instead of using the reciprocal of 6, which is 1/6.
- D. 1/8 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 1/8

**Explanation:** Divide by 6 means multiply by 1/6: 3/4 ÷ 6 = 3/4 × 1/6 = 3/24 = 1/8.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns1_yogurt_groups_001

**Prompt:** You have 2/3 cup of yogurt. Each serving is 1/6 cup. How many servings can you make? (Answer as a whole number.)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied instead of dividing. This question asks how many 1/6-cups fit into 2/3, which is division.
- B. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You inverted the wrong fraction. You flipped 2/3 instead of flipping the serving size 1/6.
- C. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You set it up correctly but made an arithmetic slip: 2/3 × 6 = 12/3, and 12/3 = 4, not 6.
- D. 4 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 4

**Explanation:** 2/3 ÷ 1/6 = 2/3 × 6 = 12/3 = 4. So you can make 4 servings.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns1_lemonade_share_001

**Prompt:** A jug has 1 1/2 liters of lemonade. It is poured equally into 3 bottles. How many liters go in each bottle? Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied instead of dividing. Sharing equally into 3 bottles means divide by 3, not multiply by 3.
- B. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You inverted the wrong number. You flipped the mixed number instead of dividing it by 3.
- C. 1/6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You forgot to convert the mixed number and used only 1/2 ÷ 3. The total is 1 1/2, not 1/2.
- D. 1/2 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 1/2

**Explanation:** Convert 1 1/2 = 3/2. Then 3/2 ÷ 3 = 3/2 × 1/3 = 3/6 = 1/2.

## Module 3: Decimals - Decimal Concepts & Operations

- Topic ID: 3.1
- Power standards: 6.NS.3
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.NS.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns3_001

**Prompt:** Find 12.7 + 3.45.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 16.15 [CORRECT]
- B. 46.15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You might have lined up digits instead of decimal points and treated 12.7 like 127.0. In addition, decimals must be aligned by the decimal point so tenths add with tenths.
- C. 12.745 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You may have just “stuck” the numbers together or added only the decimal parts. You need to add the whole-number parts and the decimal parts using place value.
- D. 16.52 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely added 7 + 45 as if they were in the same place value. Write 12.7 as 12.70 so hundredths line up before adding.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 16.15

**Explanation:** Line up the decimal points: 12.70 + 3.45. Add hundredths and tenths (70 + 45 = 115 hundredths = 1.15), then add whole numbers: 12 + 3 + 1 = 16, so the sum is 16.15.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns3_002

**Prompt:** Find 50.2 − 7.85.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 42.35 [CORRECT]
- B. 43.17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely subtracted without borrowing correctly across the decimal. In 50.20 − 7.85, you must borrow 1 tenth as 10 hundredths (and possibly borrow from the whole number too).
- C. 42.17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You may have subtracted 85 from 20 as if you could do 20 − 85 without regrouping. You need to rename 50.20 by borrowing so the hundredths place is large enough.
- D. 48.35 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You might have subtracted only the decimal part (0.2 − 0.85) incorrectly and kept 50 − 7 as 48. You must subtract the whole number and decimal parts together after lining up decimals.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 42.35

**Explanation:** Write 50.2 as 50.20. Subtract 7.85 using regrouping: borrow so 120 hundredths becomes available in the decimal part, then subtract to get 42.35.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns3_003

**Prompt:** Find 14.6 × 3.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 43.8 [CORRECT]
- B. 4.38 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed the decimal too far left. Multiply as whole numbers (146 × 3 = 438) and then put the decimal back using the one decimal place in 14.6.
- C. 438 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You forgot to put the decimal back in the product. Since 14.6 has one digit after the decimal, the answer must also have one digit after the decimal.
- D. 44.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You may have multiplied only the whole-number part and then added the decimal part. The 0.6 is part of 14.6, so it must also be multiplied by 3.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 43.8

**Explanation:** Compute 146 × 3 = 438, then place the decimal one spot from the right because 14.6 has 1 decimal place. The product is 43.8.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns3_004

**Prompt:** Find 2.4 × 0.35.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.84 [CORRECT]
- B. 8.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied 24 × 35 correctly but didn’t place the decimal. The product must have 1 + 2 = 3 decimal places total.
- C. 0.084 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You counted one extra decimal place. 2.4 has 1 decimal place and 0.35 has 2, so the answer should have 3 decimal places, not 4.
- D. 0.89 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely made a multiplication error with the whole-number version. 24 × 35 should be 840, and then you place the decimal.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 0.84

**Explanation:** Multiply as whole numbers: 24 × 35 = 840. There are 1 + 2 = 3 decimal places in the factors, so place the decimal three places from the right: 0.840 = 0.84.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns3_005

**Prompt:** Find 12.48 ÷ 3.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4.16 [CORRECT]
- B. 41.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You moved the decimal in the quotient the wrong way. When dividing by a whole number, keep the decimal in the quotient lined up with the decimal in the dividend.
- C. 0.416 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed the decimal too far left, as if you divided by 30 instead of 3. In long division, bring the decimal point straight up into the quotient.
- D. 4.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely stopped too early or didn’t divide the hundredths place. 12.48 has hundredths, so you must continue dividing past the decimal to include them.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 4.16

**Explanation:** Do long division: 12 ÷ 3 = 4. Bring the decimal up, then 0.48 ÷ 3 = 0.16, so the total is 4.16.

## Module 4: Integers (Negative Numbers) - Understanding Integers

**Explanation:** Values below zero are represented by negative numbers. So 7 below zero is -7.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ns5_elevation_001

**Prompt:** A diver is 12 meters below sea level. Which integer represents this position?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You ignored that below sea level is negative.
- B. -12 [CORRECT]
- C. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You 0 represents sea level, not below it.
- D. 1/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You converted the value to a fraction instead of using a signed integer.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. -12

**Explanation:** Below sea level is represented by negative values, so 12 meters below is -12.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ns5_credit_debit_001

**Prompt:** In a bank account context, which pair correctly matches the signs?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Deposit is negative, withdrawal is positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You reversed the usual sign convention for gains and losses.
- B. Deposit is positive, withdrawal is negative. [CORRECT]
- C. Both deposit and withdrawal are positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You using the same sign loses the idea of opposite directions of change.
- D. Both deposit and withdrawal are negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You using the same sign loses the distinction between adding and removing value.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Deposit is positive, withdrawal is negative.

**Explanation:** Deposits increase account balance (positive). Withdrawals decrease balance (negative).

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ns5_zero_meaning_001

**Prompt:** Which statement best describes the meaning of 0 in a temperature context?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 means no temperature exists. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You 0 is a point on the number line, not the absence of the quantity.
- B. 0 means the temperature is exactly at the reference point between positive and negative values. [CORRECT]
- C. 0 means the temperature is positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You 0 is neither positive nor negative.
- D. 0 means the temperature is negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You 0 is not negative; it separates positive and negative values.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0 means the temperature is exactly at the reference point between positive and negative values.

**Explanation:** In contexts like temperature, 0 is a reference value that separates values above and below that point.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ns5_context_compare_001

**Prompt:** Which value represents a larger gain?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You negative values represent losses or opposite direction, not gains.
- B. +5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this is a gain, but not the larger one among the options.
- C. +9 [CORRECT]
- D. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You 0 means no gain or loss, not a larger gain.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. +9

**Explanation:** Gains are represented by positive numbers. Among +5 and +9, +9 is the larger gain.

### Standard 6.NS.7 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns7_order_list_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {−1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2}. Which list shows these numbers in order from least to greatest (left to right on a number line)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2 [CORRECT]
- B. −1.5, −1.75, −0.25, 0.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You compared the digits and treated the negatives like positives. For negatives, the number closer to 0 is actually greater.
- C. −1.75, −0.25, −1.5, 0.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You placed −0.25 to the left of −1.5 as if "0.25 is smaller than 1.5." The sign matters: −0.25 is closer to 0, so it should be to the right of −1.5.
- D. 0.2, −0.25, −1.5, −1.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You reversed the direction of the number line. Numbers increase as you move right, not left.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2

**Explanation:** On a number line, farther left means smaller. Among negatives, the one with the larger distance from 0 is smaller (so −1.75 < −1.5).

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns7_compare_rationals_001

**Prompt:** Choose the correct comparison: (−2/3) ___ (−0.6)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (−2/3 < −0.6) [CORRECT]
- B. (−2/3 > −0.6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You compared the sizes 0.67 and 0.6 and forgot that with negatives, the one farther from 0 is actually smaller.
- C. (−2/3 = −0.6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You rounded −0.666... to −0.6 and treated it as exact. A rounded value doesn't make them equal.
- D. (−0.6 < −2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated "less than" like it means "closer to zero" without checking which side is actually farther left on the number line.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (−2/3 < −0.6)

**Explanation:** −2/3 = −0.666..., which is to the left of −0.6 on the number line, so it's smaller.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns7_abs_value_distance_001

**Prompt:** A diver is at (−7.5) meters (m) relative to sea level (0 m). What is the diver's distance from sea level?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7.5 m [CORRECT]
- B. −7.5 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You kept the negative sign, but distance is how far, not which direction. Distance cannot be negative.
- C. 0 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated sea level as the answer without measuring the gap from (−7.5) to 0.
- D. 15 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You measured from (−7.5) to (+7.5) instead of from (−7.5) to 0.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 7.5 m

**Explanation:** Absolute value is distance from 0. |−7.5| = 7.5.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns7_greatest_negative_001

**Prompt:** Which number is greatest?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −0.6 [CORRECT]
- B. −0.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You thought "75 is bigger than 60 so it must be bigger." With negatives, the number closer to 0 is greater.
- C. (−2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You focused on the fraction looking "big" and didn't compare its decimal value. (−2/3 ≈ −0.666...) which is less than −0.6.
- D. (−5/8) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You compared 5 and 8 without converting or estimating. (−5/8 = −0.625), which is close, but still less than −0.6.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −0.6

**Explanation:** For negative numbers, the greatest is the one closest to 0. Among these, −0.6 is closest to 0.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns7_reasoning_order_001

**Prompt:** Which explanation correctly shows why (−3 > −8)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (−3) is to the right of (−8) on the number line, so (−3) is greater. [CORRECT]
- B. Because 8 is greater than 3, (−8) must be greater than (−3). [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You compared the digits and ignored how negatives work. A larger absolute value means the number is farther left, not greater.
- C. Since |−8| > |−3|, (−8) is greater. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used absolute value to decide which is greater. Absolute value tells distance from 0, not which number is larger.
- D. Any negative number is greater than any other negative number if it has the minus sign. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the negative sign like it makes numbers all "the same kind." Negatives still have an order based on position on the number line.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (−3) is to the right of (−8) on the number line, so (−3) is greater.

**Explanation:** On a number line, numbers increase as you move right. (−3) is closer to 0 (to the right of (−8)), so (−3) is greater.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. $3.33 per notebook [CORRECT]
- B. $0.30 per notebook [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided notebooks by dollars, which flips the rate. That gives notebooks per dollar, not dollars per notebook.
- C. $10 per 3 notebooks [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You kept the ratio "per 3" instead of converting it to "per 1 notebook.".
- D. $3.30 per notebook [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You rounded too early and stopped at one decimal place before writing the final answer to the nearest cent.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. $3.33 per notebook

**Explanation:** Divide total dollars by total notebooks: 10 ÷ 3 = 3.333.... Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $3.33 per notebook.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6rp2_mph_001

**Prompt:** A car travels 120 miles in 3 hours. What is its speed in miles per hour?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 40 miles per hour [CORRECT]
- B. 0.67 miles per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used minutes instead of hours, so your "per" unit doesn't match miles per hour.
- C. 120 miles per hour [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 120 miles as if it happened in 1 hour and forgot to divide by 3 hours.
- D. 0.025 hours per mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You flipped the rate; that's hours per mile, not miles per hour.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 40 miles per hour

**Explanation:** Speed is distance ÷ time: 120 ÷ 3 = 40. So the unit rate is 40 miles per hour.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6rp2_per_10_min_001

**Prompt:** A runner goes 3 miles in 30 minutes at a constant rate. What is the unit rate in miles per 10 minutes?

- C. 12 cookies per $4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You didn't convert the rate to "per $1.".
- D. 0.33 cookies per $1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided $4 by 12 instead of 12 by $4, so the numerator/denominator got swapped.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3 cookies per $1

**Explanation:** Cookies per dollar means 12 ÷ 4 = 3, so the unit rate is 3 cookies per $1.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6rp2_unit_rate_decimal_001

**Prompt:** A cyclist rides 12 miles in 1.5 hours. Which statement correctly describes the unit rate?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The cyclist rides 8 miles per hour. [CORRECT]

  - Misconception: Misconception: You rounded 1.5 hours to 2 hours before dividing, which changes the rate.
- C. The cyclist rides 12 miles per hour. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used the 12 miles as if it happened in 1 hour and didn't divide by 1.5 hours.
- D. The cyclist rides 0.125 hours per mile. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You flipped the rate; that's hours per mile, not miles per hour.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. The cyclist rides 8 miles per hour.

**Explanation:** Miles per hour means miles ÷ hours: 12 ÷ 1.5 = 8. So the unit rate is 8 miles per hour.

## Module 5: Ratios, Rates & Percentages - Percentage Basics

- Topic ID: 5.2
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.RP.3

### Standard 6.RP.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6rp3_pct_of_001

**Prompt:** Find 20% of 50.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1000 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 20% like the number 20 and did 20 × 50. Percent means "out of 100," not "times 20.".
- B. 10 [CORRECT]
- C. 2.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided 50 ÷ 20, but "20% of 50" means take a part of 50, which uses multiplication by a percent.
- D. 30 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted 20 from 50 as if 20% meant "take away 20." A percent is not the same as subtracting that number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 10

**Explanation:** 20% means 20 per 100, so 20% = 0.20. Compute 0.20 × 50 = 10.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6rp3_find_whole_001

**Prompt:** 24 is 60% of a number. What is the number?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1440 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 60% like 60 and did 24 × 60. Percent is a ratio out of 100, not a whole-number multiplier.
- B. 40 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You did 24 ÷ 60 and forgot that 60% means 60/100, not 60.
- D. 84 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the part and the percent: 24 + 60. The percent is not another amount to add to the part.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 40

**Explanation:** "24 is 60% of the whole" means 0.60 × whole = 24. So whole = 24 ÷ 0.60 = 40.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6rp3_compare_pct_001

**Prompt:** Which is larger: 25% of 60 or 30% of 40?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 25% of 60 [CORRECT]
- B. 30% of 40 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose the bigger percent (30%) without checking the wholes. A bigger percent of a smaller number can still be smaller.
- C. They are equal [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You assumed the higher percent "balances out" the smaller whole. You still need to compare the actual amounts.
- D. Not enough information [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You can find each amount from the given numbers. You don't need any extra information.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 25% of 60

**Explanation:** 25% of 60 is 0.25 × 60 = 15. 30% of 40 is 0.30 × 40 = 12, so 15 is larger.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6rp3_table_pct_001

**Prompt:** Use the table to find 25% of the number.

| Percent of a number | Value |
|---|---|
| 10% | 6 |
| 50% | 30 |
| 100% | 60 |

What is 25% of the number?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 150 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used 25 like a whole number and multiplied 25 × 6. But 25% means 25 out of 100, not "times 25.".
- B. 15 [CORRECT]
- C. 2.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided 60 ÷ 25, but 25% is not 25; it's 25/100.
- D. 35 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You did 60 − 25, mixing a percent with a whole-number subtraction. You can't subtract "25%" as if it's 25.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 15

**Explanation:** If 10% is 6, then 50% is 30, which matches the table (so the whole is 60). Since 25% is half of 50%, it is 30 ÷ 2 = 15.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6rp3_equation_pct_001

**Prompt:** A fundraiser has reached 45% of its goal. It has raised $180 so far. Let G be the total goal amount (in dollars). Which equation correctly represents this situation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 45G = 180 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 45% like 45. Percent means per 100, so 45% should be written as 0.45 or 45/100.
- B. 0.45G = 180 [CORRECT]
- C. G ÷ 0.45 = 180 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You put the division in the wrong place. The situation says "part = percent of whole," so the percent should multiply the whole.
- D. 0.45 × 180 = G [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied the percent by the part, which mixes up part and whole. The percent should be applied to the goal (G), not to 180.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0.45G = 180

**Explanation:** "180 is 45% of the goal" means part = percent × whole. So 180 = 0.45 × G, written as 0.45G = 180.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ee1_eval_cube_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 5³.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You did 5 × 3. But 5³ means three 5's multiplied together, not 5 times 3.
- B. 125 [CORRECT]
- C. 243 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You flipped it and did 3⁵. Don't swap base and exponent—5³ is different from 3⁵.
- D. 25 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You only multiplied two 5's, like 5². The exponent 3 needs three 5's: 5 × 5 × 5.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 125

**Explanation:** 5³ = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ee1_order_ops_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 2³ + 4 × 2.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 4 × 2 like just "+4" and didn't multiply by 2. The × means multiply first, then add.
- B. 14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 2³ like 2 × 3. Exponents mean repeated multiplication: 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2.
- C. 16 [CORRECT]
- D. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added 2³ + 4 first and then multiplied by 2. Multiplication comes before addition unless parentheses say otherwise.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 16

**Explanation:** Do the exponent first: 2³ = 8. Then multiply: 4 × 2 = 8. Finally add: 8 + 8 = 16.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ee1_neg_square_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate BOTH expressions: (1) (−3)² and (2) −3². Choose the correct pair of values in order.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 and −9 [CORRECT]
- B. −9 and −9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You acted like the parentheses don't matter. But (−3)² squares the negative number inside the parentheses.
- C. 9 and 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You assumed "squaring always makes it positive," but in −3² the square happens first, then the negative sign is applied.
- D. −9 and 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You swapped which expression has the negative included in the square. The parentheses decide whether the −3 is squared or not.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 9 and −9

**Explanation:** (−3)² = (−3) × (−3) = 9. But −3² = −(3²) = −9 because the exponent applies to 3, not the negative sign.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ee1_translate_expr_001

**Prompt:** Which expression matches the words: "the square of the sum of 2 and 5"?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (2 + 5)² [CORRECT]
- B. 2² + 5² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You squared each number separately. The words say square the sum, so you must add first, then square.
- C. 2 + 5² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You squared only the 5. The phrase "square of the sum" means the entire (2 + 5) gets squared.
- D. (2 + 5) × 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated "square" like "multiply by 2." Squaring means multiply the quantity by itself.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (2 + 5)²

**Explanation:** "Sum of 2 and 5" is (2 + 5). "Square of" means square that whole group: (2 + 5)².

### Standard 6.EE.2 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee2_read_expr_001

- Topic ID: 6.2
- Power standards: 6.EE.5, 6.EE.6, 6.EE.7
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.EE.5 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of answering a question: which values from a specified set, if any, make the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether a given number in a specified set makes an equation or inequality true.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ee5_substitute_eq_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4}. Does x = 2 make the equation 3x = 6 true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Yes, x = 2 makes the equation true. [CORRECT]
- B. No, x = 2 does not make the equation true. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added 3 + 2 instead of multiplying 3 × 2, so you didn’t actually check 3x.
- C. Yes, because 6 ÷ 3 = 3. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You solved for x and got 3, but the question is asking whether x = 2 works; you still need to substitute 2.
- D. No, because 2 ÷ 3 = 0.67, not 6. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided the numbers the wrong way; the equation is 3 × x, not x ÷ 3.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Yes, x = 2 makes the equation true.

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 2 into 3x: 3 × 2 = 6. Since the left side equals 6, the equation is true for x = 2.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ee5_substitute_decimal_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {0.7, 1.1, 1.5, 2.1}. Which set of values makes the equation x − 0.4 = 1.1 true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. {1.5} [CORRECT]
- B. {1.1} [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose the number on the right side without substituting; x has to be tested in x − 0.4, not matched to 1.1.
- C. {0.7} [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You did 1.1 − 0.4 and treated that as x, but the equation says x is the number you subtract 0.4 from.
- D. {0.7, 1.5} [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You didn’t check each value carefully; only one of these makes the left side equal 1.1.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. {1.5}

**Explanation:** Substitute each candidate. Only x = 1.5 works because 1.5 − 0.4 = 1.1.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ee5_check_inequality_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {5, 7, 8, 9}. Does x = 7 make the inequality x + 3 < 10 true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. No, x = 7 does not make the inequality true. [CORRECT]
- B. Yes, x = 7 makes the inequality true. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You included the “equal” case; 7 + 3 equals 10, but the inequality is “< 10,” not “≤ 10.”.
- C. Yes, because 10 − 3 = 7. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You solved like it was an equation and stopped; you still need to substitute 7 and check whether the result is strictly less than 10.
- D. Yes, because 7 is less than 10. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You compared x to 10 but forgot to add 3 first; the inequality is about x + 3.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. No, x = 7 does not make the inequality true.

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 7: 7 + 3 = 10. Since 10 is not less than 10, the inequality is false for x = 7.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ee5_check_solution_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4}. You are checking whether x = 2 is a solution to the equation x + 5 = 9. Which statement is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Substitute 2: 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 ≠ 9, so x = 2 is NOT a solution. [CORRECT]
- B. 9 − 5 = 4, so x = 2 IS a solution. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found what x should be, but you didn’t compare that to the given value x = 2.
- C. Substitute 2: 2 + 5 = 9, so x = 2 IS a solution. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You made an arithmetic error; 2 + 5 equals 7, not 9.
- D. Substitute 2: 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 < 9, so x = 2 IS a solution. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated an equation like an inequality; equations require both sides to be equal.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Substitute 2: 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 ≠ 9, so x = 2 is NOT a solution.

**Explanation:** Checking means substitute the given value and compare both sides. With x = 2, the left side becomes 7, which does not equal 9, so it’s not a solution.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ee5_translate_statement_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {3.4, 4.0, 4.6, 5.2}. “When you subtract 0.6 from x, you get 3.4.” Which value of x makes this statement true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose the result (3.4) as x, but you need x such that x − 0.6 equals 3.4.
- B. 4.0 [CORRECT]
- C. 4.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added 0.6 to the wrong side in your thinking; check by substituting to see whether 4.6 − 0.6 equals 3.4.
- D. 5.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You likely treated 0.6 like 6 or made a place-value slip; subtracting 0.6 should change the number by less than 1.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4.0

**Explanation:** Substitute each option into x − 0.6. Only 4.0 works because 4.0 − 0.6 = 3.4.

### Standard 6.EE.6 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set.

- C. n/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided by 5 instead of multiplying by 5 groups.
- D. 5 + n + n [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You mixed constants and variables without representing 5 full groups.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 5n

**Explanation:** If one notebook costs n, then 5 notebooks cost 5 x n = 5n.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee6_perimeter_001

**Prompt:** A rectangle has length l and width 4. Which expression gives its perimeter?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. l + 4 [WRONG]

- B. 2l + 8 [CORRECT]
- C. 4l [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated all sides as length l.
- D. l x 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used area formula structure instead of perimeter.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 2l + 8

**Explanation:** Perimeter is 2(length) + 2(width) = 2l + 2(4) = 2l + 8.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee6_age_expr_001

**Prompt:** Mia is a years old. Her brother is 3 years older. Which expression represents her brother's age?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. a - 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted even though 'older' means add.
- B. 3a [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied by 3 instead of adding 3 years.
- C. a + 3 [CORRECT]
- D. a/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You divided by 3 instead of representing an age difference.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. a + 3

**Explanation:** Older by 3 means add 3: brother's age is a + 3.

## Module 6: Algebra - Patterns & Relations

- Topic ID: 6.3
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.EE.9

### Standard 6.EE.9 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that change in relationship to one another; write an equation to express one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the other quantity, thought of as the independent variable. Analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using graphs and tables, and relate these to the equation.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ee9_indep_dep_001

**Prompt:** Movie tickets cost $6 each. Let t = number of tickets and c = total cost. Which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Independent: c, Dependent: t [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You swapped them. The total cost depends on how many tickets you buy, not the other way around.
- B. Independent: t, Dependent: c [CORRECT]
- C. Independent: 6, Dependent: c [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the price "6" like a variable that changes. The $6 is a constant, not one of the changing quantities.
- D. Independent: c, Dependent: 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose the cost as "independent" because it looks like the main number. But cost changes because the number of tickets changes.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Independent: t, Dependent: c

**Explanation:** You choose how many tickets to buy first, so t is independent. The cost c changes based on t, so c is dependent.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ee9_write_eq_001

**Prompt:** A game gives you 2 bonus points to start, then 3 points for each level you complete. Let x = number of levels and y = total points. Which equation matches the situation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = 3x + 2 [CORRECT]
- B. y = 2x + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You switched the starting bonus and the "points per level." The bonus is the constant, and the per-level points multiply x.
- C. y = 3x − 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted the bonus instead of adding it. The situation says you start with extra points, so it should increase the total.
- D. y = 3(x + 2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied the bonus by 3 as if the bonus repeats every level. The bonus happens once at the start, so it should be added, not multiplied.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. y = 3x + 2

**Explanation:** "3 points per level" means 3x. "2 bonus points to start" is a one-time add-on, so y = 3x + 2.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ee9_table_eq_001

**Prompt:** This table shows how many stickers (y) you have after buying (x) packs. Choose the equation that matches the table.

Table:
x: 0, 1, 2, 3
y: 1, 5, 9, 13

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = 4x + 1 [CORRECT]
- B. y = 4x − 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used the right "+4 each pack" pattern but chose the wrong starting value. When x = 0, the table shows y = 1, not −1.
- C. y = x + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You noticed "add 4" in the table, but you made the multiplier 1. The table increases by 4 each time x increases by 1, so the coefficient should be 4.
- D. y = 5x + 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You picked the wrong step size. The stickers go up by 4 each pack, not 5.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. y = 4x + 1

**Explanation:** Each time x increases by 1, y increases by 4, so the rate is 4. When x = 0, y = 1, so the equation is y = 4x + 1.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ee9_eval_eq_001

**Prompt:** The relationship between x and y is y = 2x + 3. Complete the table value for x = 5.

Table:
x: 1, 2, 5
y: 5, 7, __

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 13 [CORRECT]
- B. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You did 2 × 5 but forgot to add the +3. The +3 is part of the rule every time.
- C. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied after adding: 2(5 + 3). In 2x + 3, the +3 is added after multiplying 2x, not inside the multiplication.
- D. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added 5 + 3 and forgot to multiply by 2. The rule says "2 times x" first, then +3.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 13

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 5 into the equation: y = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ee9_rate_change_001

**Prompt:** A carnival charges a $4 entry fee plus $2 per ride. Let x = number of rides and y = total cost. The equation is y = 2x + 4. Which statement about how y changes when x increases is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $2. [CORRECT]
- B. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $4. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used the entry fee as the change each ride. The $4 happens once, not every time x goes up.
- C. Each time x increases by 1, y doubles. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 2x like "multiply the whole cost by 2 each step." But 2x means add $2 per ride, not doubling.
- D. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $6. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You combined the entry fee and per-ride cost as if both repeat each ride. The entry fee doesn't repeat when you take another ride.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $2.

**Explanation:** In y = 2x + 4, the coefficient 2 tells the rate: $2 per ride. The +4 is the starting cost when x = 0, not the per-ride change.

## Module 6: Algebra - Inequalities & Constraints

- D. h + 140 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this is an expression, not an inequality.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. h > 140

**Explanation:** "Taller than 140" means strictly greater, so h > 140.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee8_002

**Prompt:** A package must weigh less than 5 kg. Let w be weight. Which inequality is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. w > 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You reversed the inequality direction.
- B. w < 5 [CORRECT]
- C. w = 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You less than does not include 5.
- D. w - 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this is not an inequality statement.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. w < 5

**Explanation:** Less than 5 means w < 5.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee8_003

**Prompt:** Which number line description matches x < -2?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Open circle at -2, arrow to the left [CORRECT]
- B. Open circle at -2, arrow to the right [WRONG]

- C. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated 3 as the count of solutions.
- D. Infinitely many [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. Infinitely many

**Explanation:** There are endlessly many numbers greater than 3, so the solution set is infinite.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee8_005

**Prompt:** A gym says age must be younger than 16 for junior membership. Let a be age. Which inequality and sample solution are both correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. a > 16, and 14 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You reversed the inequality.
- B. a < 16, and 14 is a solution [CORRECT]
- C. a < 16, and 16 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You strict less-than does not include 16.
- D. a = 16, and 16 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You equality does not match a strict inequality condition.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. a < 16, and 14 is a solution

**Explanation:** "Younger than 16" means a < 16, and 14 satisfies that condition.

  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the bases and multiplied by the height, but forgot to take half. Trapezoid area uses the average of the bases.
- B. 32 cm² [CORRECT]
- C. 40 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated it like a rectangle using only the longer base: 10 × 4. A trapezoid has two bases, so you must use both.
- D. 30 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You multiplied the bases and then halved. Trapezoid area does not use "base times base.".

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 32 cm²

**Explanation:** A = ½(b₁ + b₂)h = ½(6 + 10) × 4 = ½ × 16 × 4 = 32 cm².

#### Q4 - q_cc_6g1_composite_add_001

**Prompt:** A composite shape is made of a rectangle plus a triangle on top. The rectangle is 8 m wide and 5 m tall. On top of it is a right triangle with base 8 m (same as the rectangle's width) and perpendicular height 3 m. What is the total area in m²?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 64 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated the triangle like a rectangle and did 8 × 3 instead of ½ × 8 × 3.
- B. 60 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used a side length that isn't the perpendicular height. The triangle's area needs the perpendicular height of 3 m.
- C. 37 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted the triangle's area. The triangle is added on top, so its area should be added, not removed.
- D. 52 m² [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 52 m²

**Explanation:** Rectangle area = 8 × 5 = 40. Triangle area = ½ × 8 × 3 = 12. Total = 40 + 12 = 52 m².

#### Q5 - q_cc_6g1_composite_sub_001

**Prompt:** A rectangular garden is 12 ft by 8 ft, but a right-triangle corner is cut out for a path. The cut-out triangle has legs 4 ft and 3 ft (the legs meet at a right angle). What is the remaining area in ft²?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 96 ft² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You found the rectangle's area but forgot to subtract the cut-out triangle. The garden is missing that corner.
- B. 84 ft² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted 4 × 3 instead of ½ × 4 × 3. The cut-out is a triangle, not a rectangle.
- C. 86 ft² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You used the wrong triangle area. The legs 4 ft and 3 ft are the base and height, so you shouldn't use a different side or method.
- D. 90 ft² [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 90 ft²

**Explanation:** Rectangle area = 12 × 8 = 96. Cut-out triangle area = ½ × 4 × 3 = 6. Remaining area = 96 − 6 = 90 ft².

#### Q1 - q_cc_6sp4_dotplot_mode_001

**Prompt:** A dot plot shows how many pages students read in one night. Each dot is 1 student.

2 pages: ●●
3 pages: ●●●●
4 pages: ●●●
5 pages: ●
6 pages: ●●

Which number of pages is the most common (the mode)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You picked the largest number of pages. The mode is the value with the most dots, not the biggest value.
- B. 4 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You counted the dots incorrectly for 3 and 4. The mode depends on which row has the most dots.
- C. 3 pages [CORRECT]
- D. 5 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose the value that "stands out" as different, but mode is about the tallest stack (most dots).

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 3 pages

**Explanation:** The most common value is the one with the most dots. "3 pages" has 4 dots, which is more than any other value.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6sp4_histogram_at_least_001

**Prompt:** A histogram groups the number of minutes students practiced piano. The bins are written as: 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39 (so 10–19 includes 10 through 19).

0–9: 5 students
10–19: 7 students
20–29: 6 students
30–39: 2 students

How many students practiced at least 20 minutes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You counted only the 20–29 bin and forgot that "at least 20" also includes 30–39.
- B. 8 students [CORRECT]
- C. 15 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You included the 10–19 bin, but "at least 20" does not include any of 10–19.
- D. 20 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the bin labels (like 20 and 39) instead of using the frequencies. Histogram questions use the counts in each bin.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 8 students

**Explanation:** "At least 20 minutes" includes the 20–29 bin and the 30–39 bin. Add their frequencies: 6 + 2 = 8.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6sp4_boxplot_median_001

**Prompt:** A box plot for quiz scores has this 5-number summary:
Min = 10, Q1 = 14, Median = 16, Q3 = 20, Max = 24
What is the median score?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose Q1. The median is the middle value, which is listed separately from Q1 and Q3.
- B. 16 [CORRECT]
- C. 20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose Q3. Q3 is the third quartile, not the median.
- D. 17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You averaged Q1 and Q3. The median is given in the 5-number summary; you don't compute it by averaging quartiles.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 16

**Explanation:** In a 5-number summary, the median is explicitly listed as the middle value. Here, the median is 16.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6sp4_choose_plot_001

**Prompt:** A school collected heights (in cm) from 240 students. The teacher wants to see how many students fall in ranges like 130–139, 140–149, 150–159, and so on. Which plot type is the best choice?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Dot plot [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You're choosing a dot plot even though there are many data points. With 240 points, dots can get crowded and hard to read.
- B. Histogram [CORRECT]
- C. Box plot [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You chose a box plot, but it won't show how many students are in each height range. It summarizes with quartiles instead of bin counts.
- D. Dot plot and box plot are equally best [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You're treating all plots as the same, but only a histogram is designed to show frequencies in bins/ranges.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Histogram

**Explanation:** A histogram is best when you want counts in intervals (bins) like 130–139 or 140–149, especially with lots of data.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6sp4_histogram_bins_001

**Prompt:** A histogram uses bins 10–19, 20–29, 30–39. A student says: "A value of 20 belongs in the 10–19 bin because it's close to 19." Which statement is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. "20 belongs in 10–19 because bins overlap." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You're assuming bins overlap, but well-made histogram bins do not overlap.
- B. "20 belongs in 20–29 because 10–19 stops at 19." [CORRECT]
- C. "20 belongs in both 10–19 and 20–29." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You're double-counting. A data value should go into exactly one bin.
- D. "20 belongs in 30–39 because you round 20 up." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You're using rounding rules that don't apply. Histogram bins are about exact boundaries, not rounding.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. "20 belongs in 20–29 because 10–19 stops at 19."

**Explanation:** Bin labels are boundaries. The bin 10–19 includes 10 through 19, so 20 is the first value in the 20–29 bin.

- C. What is the classroom number? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this has one fixed answer for the class.
- D. What is 100 divided by 4? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this is a single arithmetic answer, not a data question.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. How many siblings do students in this class have?

**Explanation:** To study variability, ask a question that will produce different answers across many students.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp1_rewrite_001

**Prompt:** Which rewrite turns a non-statistical question into a statistical one?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. From 'How old am I?' to 'How old are students in Grade 6?' [CORRECT]
- B. From 'What is my shoe size?' to 'What is my shoe size exactly?' [WRONG]

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp2_distribution_desc_001

**Prompt:** Which description correctly uses center, spread, and shape?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Center is where most data lie, spread is how far values vary, and shape describes pattern of distribution. [CORRECT]
- B. Center is always the largest value, spread is always zero, and shape is not useful. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You this confuses all three distribution features.
- C. Center and spread are the same thing. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You center describes typical value; spread describes variability.
- D. Shape is only for geometry, not data. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You distribution shape is a core data concept.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Center is where most data lie, spread is how far values vary, and shape describes pattern of distribution.

**Explanation:** Data distributions are summarized by center (typical value), spread (variability), and shape (pattern).

### Standard 6.SP.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number.

### Standard 7.NS.1 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.

#### Q1 - q_cc_7ns1_add_int_001

**Prompt:** Compute −4 + 7.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You added the absolute values but kept the negative sign even though 7 has the larger absolute value.
- B. 3 [CORRECT]
- C. −3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You subtracted 7 − 4 but chose the wrong sign for the result.
- D. 11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You ignored the negative sign and added 4 + 7 as if both were positive.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3

**Explanation:** When adding a negative and a positive, subtract the absolute values (7 − 4 = 3) and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value (positive).

#### Q2 - q_cc_7ns1_sub_dblneg_001

**Prompt:** Compute −5 − (−2).

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You treated subtracting a negative like subtracting a positive: −5 − 2.
- B. −3 [CORRECT]
- C. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You flipped both signs and computed 5 + 2 instead of keeping the −5.
- D. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Misconception: You reversed the order and effectively did (−2) − (−5) instead of −5 − (−2).

**Correct Answer(s):** B. −3

**Explanation:** Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive: −5 − (−2) = −5 + 2 = −3.

#### Q3 - q_cc_7ns1_sub_pos_001

**Prompt:** Compute −3 − 7.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −10 [CORRECT]
- B. −4 [WRONG]
