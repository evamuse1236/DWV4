#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns3_005

**Prompt:** Find 12.48 ÷ 3.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4.16 [CORRECT]
- B. 41.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close! It looks like the decimal point in the answer might have shifted a spot too far to the right. When dividing by a whole number, keeping the decimal point lined up exactly above the one in the starting number will help.
- C. 0.416 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the decimal point moved to the left, making the number smaller. In long division, we can usually just bring that decimal point straight up to the answer line!
- D. 4.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're on the right track! It seems like the division might have stopped a bit early. Don't forget to include those hundredths at the end of 12.48 for the final answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 4.16

**Explanation:** Do long division: 12 ÷ 3 = 4. Bring the decimal up, then 0.48 ÷ 3 = 0.16, so the total is 4.16.

## Module 4: Integers (Negative Numbers) - Understanding Integers

- Topic ID: 4.1
- Power standards: 6.NS.5, 6.NS.7
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.NS.5 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together to describe quantities having opposite directions or values (e.g., temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level, credits/debits, positive/negative electric charge); use positive and negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in each situation.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ns5_temp_sign_001

**Prompt:** A temperature of 7 deg C below zero is represented by:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -7 [CORRECT]
- B. +7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Usually, when we talk about anything "below zero," it's a signal to use negative numbers to show that the value is less than zero.
- C. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 0 means we're exactly at the zero mark, but "7 below" means the temperature has moved down by seven steps.
- D. 7/0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That notation looks like a division problem. In this case, we just need a negative sign to show a temperature below zero.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -7

**Explanation:** Values below zero are represented by negative numbers. So 7 below zero is -7.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ns5_elevation_001

**Prompt:** A diver is 12 meters below sea level. Which integer represents this position?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! In math, "below sea level" is represented by a negative sign to show it's less than our starting point of zero.
- B. -12 [CORRECT]
- C. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! We use 0 to mark exactly where sea level is. Since the diver is underneath that point, we'll need a negative number to show their location.
- D. 1/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like a fraction was used, but we can represent positions like this with positive or negative integers!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. -12

**Explanation:** Below sea level is represented by negative values, so 12 meters below is -12.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ns5_credit_debit_001

**Prompt:** In a bank account context, which pair correctly matches the signs?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Deposit is negative, withdrawal is positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the signs were swapped. Just like adding items to a group, putting money in (a deposit) is positive, while taking it out (a withdrawal) is negative.
- B. Deposit is positive, withdrawal is negative. [CORRECT]
- C. Both deposit and withdrawal are positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: If both had the same sign, we wouldn't be able to tell if money was coming or going! Using different signs helps us track if the balance is growing or shrinking.
- D. Both deposit and withdrawal are negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since these actions change the account in opposite ways, we need both a positive sign and a negative sign to tell them apart.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Deposit is positive, withdrawal is negative.

**Explanation:** Deposits increase account balance (positive). Withdrawals decrease balance (negative).

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ns5_zero_meaning_001

**Prompt:** Which statement best describes the meaning of 0 in a temperature context?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 means no temperature exists. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Even when it's very cold, a temperature always exists. 0 is just a specific point on the thermometer's scale!
- B. 0 means the temperature is exactly at the reference point between positive and negative values. [CORRECT]
- C. 0 means the temperature is positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, 0 is a very special number that sits right in the middle—it isn't positive and it isn't negative!
- D. 0 means the temperature is negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, 0 is the starting point that separates the positive territory from the negative territory.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0 means the temperature is exactly at the reference point between positive and negative values.

**Explanation:** In contexts like temperature, 0 is a reference value that separates values above and below that point.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ns5_context_compare_001

**Prompt:** Which value represents a larger gain?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the size of the number was the main focus. While 9 is a large amount, the negative sign means it's a loss rather than a gain!
- B. +5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is definitely a gain! If you compare it to the other positive number, you'll find an even bigger one.
- C. +9 [CORRECT]
- D. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 0 means that nothing changed at all—there was no gain and no loss.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. +9

**Explanation:** Gains are represented by positive numbers. Among +5 and +9, +9 is the larger gain.

### Standard 6.NS.7 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns7_order_list_001

**Prompt:** x is chosen from {−1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2}. Which list shows these numbers in order from least to greatest (left to right on a number line)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2 [CORRECT]
- B. −1.5, −1.75, −0.25, 0.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! With negative numbers, it helps to remember that the more negative a number is (further left), the smaller it actually is. So -1.75 is smaller than -1.5.
- C. −1.75, −0.25, −1.5, 0.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like -0.25 might have been thought of as smaller than -1.5. Even though 0.25 is a smaller value, it's actually much closer to zero (further right) than -1.5 is!
- D. 0.2, −0.25, −1.5, −1.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like these were listed from greatest to least. For "least to greatest," we always want to head towards the positive numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −1.75, −1.5, −0.25, 0.2

**Explanation:** On a number line, farther left means smaller. Among negatives, the one with the larger distance from 0 is smaller (so −1.75 < −1.5).

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns7_compare_rationals_001

**Prompt:** Choose the correct comparison: (−2/3) ___ (−0.6)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (−2/3 < −0.6) [CORRECT]
- B. (−2/3 > −0.6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! You're right that 0.67 is bigger than 0.6, but because both are negative, the number further from zero (-2/3) is actually the smaller one on the number line.
- C. (−2/3 = −0.6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! While -0.666... is very nearly -0.6, they aren't quite identical.
- D. (−0.6 < −2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Let's double-check their spots on the number line—the number furthest to the left is always the smaller one!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (−2/3 < −0.6)

**Explanation:** −2/3 = −0.666..., which is to the left of −0.6 on the number line, so it's smaller.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns7_abs_value_distance_001

**Prompt:** A diver is at (−7.5) meters (m) relative to sea level (0 m). What is the diver's distance from sea level?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7.5 m [CORRECT]
- B. −7.5 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the diver's location exactly right! When we talk about "distance," we use positive numbers because we're just measuring the gap between two points, regardless of direction.
- C. 0 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! While sea level is 0, the diver is a few meters away from it. We're looking for that total measurement between the two.
- D. 15 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the distance was doubled. We only need the distance from the diver up to the water's surface at 0.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 7.5 m

**Explanation:** Absolute value is distance from 0. |−7.5| = 7.5.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns7_greatest_negative_001

**Prompt:** Which number is greatest?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −0.6 [CORRECT]
- B. −0.75 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is tricky. While 75 looks bigger than 60, with negative numbers, the one closer to zero (which is -0.6) is actually the greatest one in the group!
- C. (−2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. Since -2/3 is about -0.666..., it's just a tiny bit further from zero than -0.6 is, making it slightly smaller.
- D. (−5/8) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! -5/8 is exactly -0.625, which is just a little bit further from zero than -0.6.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −0.6

**Explanation:** For negative numbers, the greatest is the one closest to 0. Among these, −0.6 is closest to 0.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns7_reasoning_order_001

**Prompt:** Which explanation correctly shows why (−3 > −8)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (−3) is to the right of (−8) on the number line, so (−3) is greater. [CORRECT]
- B. Because 8 is greater than 3, (−8) must be greater than (−3). [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's natural to think that! But when we add a negative sign, everything swaps—a larger absolute value actually means the number is smaller because it's further to the left.
- C. Since |−8| > |−3|, (−8) is greater. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Absolute value measures distance from zero, but distance doesn't always tell us which number is larger in terms of the number line.
- D. Any negative number is greater than any other negative number if it has the minus sign. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, negative numbers still follow a specific order. The ones closer to zero are always greater than the ones further away.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (−3) is to the right of (−8) on the number line, so (−3) is greater.

**Explanation:** On a number line, numbers increase as you move right. (−3) is closer to 0 (to the right of (−8)), so (−3) is greater.

## Module 4: Integers (Negative Numbers) - Signed Coordinates & Number Lines

- Topic ID: 4.4
- Power standards: 6.NS.6
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.NS.6 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ns6_opp_num_001

**Prompt:** What is the opposite of -8 on the number line?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Remember that "opposites" are like mirror images—they're the same distance from zero, but on the other side, so their signs swap!
- B. 8 [CORRECT]
- C. -16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close, but it looks like the number was doubled. We just want to jump across zero from the negative side to the positive side.
- D. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 0 is the starting point that sits right between any pair of opposites.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 8

**Explanation:** Opposites have equal distance from 0 and opposite signs. The opposite of -8 is 8.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ns6_quadrant_001

**Prompt:** In which quadrant is the point (-3, 5)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Quadrant I [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! For Quadrant I, both the x and y numbers need to be positive. Since our x-value is -3, we're in a different section of the graph.
- B. Quadrant II [CORRECT]
- C. Quadrant III [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! In Quadrant III, both coordinates would have to be negative.
- D. Quadrant IV [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! Quadrant IV is for points with a positive x and a negative y—just the opposite of our point!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Quadrant II

**Explanation:** Quadrant II has negative x-values and positive y-values, matching (-3, 5).

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ns6_plot_move_001

**Prompt:** Start at point (-2, 3). Move right 5 and down 4. What is the new point?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (3, -1) [CORRECT]
- B. (-7, -1) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you moved 5 steps to the left instead of the right. Moving right means adding to the x-value!
- C. (3, 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost there! It seems you moved up by 4 instead of down. Moving down means we subtract from the y-value.
- D. (-1, 3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! It looks like the moves for x and y might have been mixed up.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (3, -1)

**Explanation:** Right 5 changes x: -2 + 5 = 3. Down 4 changes y: 3 - 4 = -1. New point is (3, -1).

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ns6_axis_point_001

**Prompt:** Which point lies on the y-axis?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (0, -4) [CORRECT]
- B. (-4, 0) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This point actually lies on the *x-axis* because its y-value is zero. The y-axis points always have x = 0.
- C. (3, 0) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. A point on the y-axis needs to stay right in the center horizontally, so its x-value must be 0.
- D. (2, -4) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since both numbers are non-zero, this point is floating out in a quadrant rather than sitting right on an axis line.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (0, -4)

**Explanation:** Points on the y-axis have x = 0. So (0, -4) is on the y-axis.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ns6_rational_point_001

**Prompt:** Which point has a negative rational x-coordinate and a positive rational y-coordinate?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (2/3, -1/2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the signs were swapped—this one has a positive x and a negative y instead.
- B. (-2/3, 1/2) [CORRECT]
- C. (-2/3, -1/2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Both of these numbers are negative, which means the point is in Quadrant III.
- D. (2/3, 1/2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since both numbers here are positive, the point belongs in Quadrant I.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (-2/3, 1/2)

**Explanation:** The condition requires x < 0 and y > 0. Only (-2/3, 1/2) matches.

## Module 5: Ratios, Rates & Percentages - Ratios & Rates

- Topic ID: 5.1
- Power standards: 6.RP.1, 6.RP.2
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.RP.1 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6rp1_simple_ratio_001

**Prompt:** A basket has 8 apples and 12 oranges. What is the ratio of apples to oranges in simplest form?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2:3 [CORRECT]
- B. 3:2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the numbers were flipped. The question specifically asked for the ratio of *apples to oranges*!
- C. 8:12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the numbers right! Now, let's see if we can simplify that ratio even further by dividing both numbers by the same amount.
- D. 4:6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're halfway there! You simplified it once, but we can still reduce it one more time to get the simplest form.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2:3

**Explanation:** Apples to oranges is 8:12. Divide both terms by 4 to get 2:3.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6rp1_language_001

**Prompt:** A class has 15 girls and 10 boys. Which statement correctly uses ratio language?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The ratio of girls to boys is 15 to 10. [CORRECT]
- B. The ratio of girls to boys is 10 to 15. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Order is very important in ratios. Since "girls" was mentioned first, their number should also come first in the ratio.
- C. The ratio of girls to boys is 25. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, a ratio should always compare two different groups rather than just showing the total sum of everyone.
- D. The ratio of girls to boys is 15/25. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! This compares the girls to the *total* number of people in the class, instead of just comparing girls to boys.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. The ratio of girls to boys is 15 to 10.

**Explanation:** Ratio language must match the order asked. Girls to boys is 15 to 10.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6rp1_part_whole_001

**Prompt:** There are 6 red marbles and 9 blue marbles. What is the ratio of red marbles to all marbles?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2:5 [CORRECT]
- B. 2:3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like you found the ratio of red to *blue* marbles. The question specially asked for the ratio of red to *all* the marbles combined.
- C. 5:2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the order was reversed. We want to list the red marbles first and the total number last.
- D. 6:9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! That's the ratio of red to blue, but let's try finding the ratio of red to the whole group of marbles.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2:5

**Explanation:** Total marbles are 6 + 9 = 15. Red to total is 6:15, which simplifies to 2:5.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6rp1_triple_ratio_001

**Prompt:** If the ratio of cats to dogs is 3:4 and there are 12 dogs, how many cats are there?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 [CORRECT]
- B. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the wrong number was scaled up. If we match our 12 dogs with the "4" in our ratio, we can see how much each part has grown.
- C. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Remember that ratio scaling works by multiplying both parts by the same number, rather than adding!
- D. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, it seems like some adding and subtracting might have happened. In ratios, using a multiplication factor will lead to the right answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 9

**Explanation:** Dogs scale factor is 12/4 = 3. Multiply cats part by 3: 3 x 3 = 9 cats.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6rp1_form_compare_001

**Prompt:** Which pair represents the same ratio as 4:7?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8:14 [CORRECT]
- B. 7:4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! Flipping the numbers completely changes what the ratio is describing.
- C. 12:14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like only one half of the ratio was scaled correctly. To stay equivalent, we must multiply both sides by the same amount.
- D. 4:11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If we only change one of the numbers, the relationship between them won't be the same as it was in 4:7.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 8:14

**Explanation:** Equivalent ratios scale both parts by the same factor. 4:7 scaled by 2 gives 8:14.

### Standard 6.RP.2 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand the concept of a unit rate *a/b* associated with a ratio *a:b* with *b* ≠ 0, and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6rp2_unit_price_001

**Prompt:** 3 notebooks cost $10. What is the unit price in dollars per notebook, to the nearest cent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. $3.33 per notebook [CORRECT]
- B. $0.30 per notebook [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the division was flipped. Dividing the dollars by the number of notebooks will give you the price for just one of them.
- C. $10 per 3 notebooks [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Good start! That's the correct total, but to find a "unit price," we need to calculate the cost for just *one* individual notebook.
- D. $3.30 per notebook [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like there was a small slip with the rounding. Carrying the division out to the second decimal place will help.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. $3.33 per notebook

**Explanation:** Divide total dollars by total notebooks: 10 ÷ 3 = 3.333.... Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $3.33 per notebook.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6rp2_mph_001

**Prompt:** A car travels 120 miles in 3 hours. What is its speed in miles per hour?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 40 miles per hour [CORRECT]
- B. 0.67 miles per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like you converted hours into minutes. The question specifically asked for miles per HOUR!
- C. 120 miles per hour [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 120 is the total for all three hours together. To find the unit speed, we want to know how far the car went in just one hour.
- D. 0.025 hours per mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That value tells us how much time it took for one mile, instead of how much distance was covered in one hour.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 40 miles per hour

**Explanation:** Speed is distance ÷ time: 120 ÷ 3 = 40. So the unit rate is 40 miles per hour.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6rp2_per_10_min_001

**Prompt:** A runner goes 3 miles in 30 minutes at a constant rate. What is the unit rate in miles per 10 minutes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 mile per 10 minutes [CORRECT]
- B. 0.1 mile per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Good job finding a unit rate! This describes the speed for 1 minute, but the question specifically asked for every 10 minutes.
- C. 6 miles per hour [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like you converted the speed to an hour. Let's try to find how far they go in just a 10-minute block.
- D. 3 miles per 30 minutes [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That's the original total. To find the unit rate for a smaller time, we'll need to divide both parts of the original ratio.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1 mile per 10 minutes

**Explanation:** 30 minutes is 3 groups of 10 minutes. 3 miles ÷ 3 = 1 mile, so it's 1 mile per 10 minutes.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6rp2_cookies_per_dollar_001

**Prompt:** A box has 12 cookies and costs $4. What is the unit rate in cookies per dollar?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 cookies per $1 [CORRECT]
- B. $0.33 per cookie [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That value shows us the price for one cookie, but the question actually asked for how many cookies we can get for one dollar.
- C. 12 cookies per $4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Good start! But to be a "unit rate," we need to narrow it down to the amount for exactly $1.
- D. 0.33 cookies per $1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the division was done in the other direction. Dividing the number of cookies by the total price will help.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3 cookies per $1

**Explanation:** Cookies per dollar means 12 ÷ 4 = 3, so the unit rate is 3 cookies per $1.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6rp2_unit_rate_decimal_001

**Prompt:** A cyclist rides 12 miles in 1.5 hours. Which statement correctly describes the unit rate?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The cyclist rides 8 miles per hour. [CORRECT]
- B. The cyclist rides 6 miles per hour. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like 1.5 was rounded up to 2 before dividing. Dividing exactly by 1.5 will give an even more accurate result.
- C. The cyclist rides 12 miles per hour. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That speed would only be true if the whole trip took exactly one hour.
- D. The cyclist rides 0.125 hours per mile. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! This describes the time per mile, but our goal is to find the miles covered in one hour.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. The cyclist rides 8 miles per hour.

**Explanation:** Miles per hour means miles ÷ hours: 12 ÷ 1.5 = 8. So the unit rate is 8 miles per hour.

## Module 5: Ratios, Rates & Percentages - Percentage Basics

- Topic ID: 5.2
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.RP.3

### Standard 6.RP.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6rp3_pct_of_001

**Prompt:** Find 20% of 50.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1000 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you multiplied 20 x 50 directly. Remember that 20% means "20 out of 100," so the final answer should be a smaller part of the total.
- B. 10 [CORRECT]
- C. 2.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems like 50 was divided by 20. When finding a "percent of" something, we use multiplication with the percentage as a decimal.
- D. 30 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like 20 was subtracted from 50. Percentages describe a specific portion of the whole amount.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 10

**Explanation:** 20% means 20 per 100, so 20% = 0.20. Compute 0.20 × 50 = 10.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6rp3_find_whole_001

**Prompt:** 24 is 60% of a number. What is the number?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1440 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the numbers were multiplied. Remember, a percentage is a ratio out of 100, not a giant whole number on its own!
- B. 40 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! Everything was set up well, but don't forget that 60% is actually 0.6 when you're doing calculations.
- D. 84 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the numbers were added, but percentages work by multiplying a specific fraction across the total.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 40

**Explanation:** "24 is 60% of the whole" means 0.60 × whole = 24. So whole = 24 ÷ 0.60 = 40.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6rp3_compare_pct_001

**Prompt:** Which is larger: 25% of 60 or 30% of 40?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 25% of 60 [CORRECT]
- B. 30% of 40 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! You picked the larger percentage (30%), but it's always good for check the actual total—sometimes a smaller percentage of a bigger number can be more!
- C. They are equal [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It's easy to think they might balance out perfectly, but if you calculate both, you'll see they come to two different totals.
- D. Not enough information [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, we have everything we need right here! We can calculate both amounts exactly with the numbers provided.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 25% of 60

**Explanation:** 25% of 60 is 0.25 × 60 = 15. 30% of 40 is 0.30 × 40 = 12, so 15 is larger.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6rp3_table_pct_001

**Prompt:** Use the table to find 25% of the number.

| Percent of a number | Value |
|---|---|
| 10% | 6 |
| 50% | 30 |
| 100% | 60 |

What is 25% of the number?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 150 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 25 was multiplied by 6. Remember, 25% is just a small portion of the whole number 60!
- B. 15 [CORRECT]
- C. 2.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems 60 was divided by 25. Let's try thinking about what part of a whole 25% (or 1/4) represents.
- D. 35 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems 25 was subtracted from 60. Percentages are a multiplier for a whole, not a separate amount to subtract.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 15

**Explanation:** If 10% is 6, then 50% is 30, which matches the table (so the whole is 60). Since 25% is half of 50%, it is 30 ÷ 2 = 15.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6rp3_equation_pct_001

**Prompt:** A fundraiser has reached 45% of its goal. It has raised $180 so far. Let G be the total goal amount (in dollars). Which equation correctly represents this situation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 45G = 180 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost there! Just remember that 45% needs to be written as its decimal form (0.45) when you use it in an equation.
- B. 0.45G = 180 [CORRECT]
- C. G ÷ 0.45 = 180 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The statement says "part = percent of whole," which is a multiplication problem rather than a division one.
- D. 0.45 × 180 = G [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the percent was multiplied by the portion raised. The percentage should actually be applied to the *goal* amount instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0.45G = 180

**Explanation:** "180 is 45% of the goal" means part = percent × whole. So 180 = 0.45 × G, written as 0.45G = 180.

## Module 6: Algebra - Expressions & Exponents

- Topic ID: 6.1
- Power standards: 6.EE.1, 6.EE.2
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.EE.1 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Write and evaluate numerical expressions involving whole-number exponents.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ee1_eval_power_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 3⁴.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the numbers were multiplied. In exponents, we multiply the base number by itself repeatedly—so it would be 3 x 3 x 3 x 3!
- B. 64 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the base and exponent were swapped (4³). In this problem, we want to use 3 as our base and multiply it four times.
- C. 81 [CORRECT]
- D. 27 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like 3 was multiplied by itself 3 times. Adding one more multiplication of 3 will get the final answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 81

**Explanation:** 3⁴ means 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ee1_eval_cube_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 5³.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 5 was multiplied by 3. Remember that 5³ is a signal to multiply 5 by itself three times: 5 x 5 x 5!
- B. 125 [CORRECT]
- C. 243 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! 3⁵ is a very different number than the 5³ we're looking for.
- D. 25 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost there! You multiplied two 5's together, but we need to multiply three of them for this exponent.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 125

**Explanation:** 5³ = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ee1_order_ops_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 2³ + 4 × 2.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the multiplication part might have been missed. In math, we always do multiplication and exponents before we add!
- B. 14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! Remember that 2³ means multiplying 2 by itself three times (2 x 2 x 2) rather than just doing 2 x 3.
- C. 16 [CORRECT]
- D. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the addition happened before the multiplication. Following the standard order of operations will help!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 16

**Explanation:** Do the exponent first: 2³ = 8. Then multiply: 4 × 2 = 8. Finally add: 8 + 8 = 16.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ee1_neg_square_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate BOTH expressions: (1) (−3)² and (2) −3². Choose the correct pair of values in order.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 and −9 [CORRECT]
- B. −9 and −9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! For (−3)², since the negative is inside the parentheses, it gets squared alongside the number. This always results in a positive answer!
- C. 9 and 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! For −3², the minus sign is on the outside. We square the 3 first, and *then* the negative sign stays with the answer.
- D. −9 and 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the rules for the signs were reversed. Parentheses tell us exactly which part of the number is being squared!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 9 and −9

**Explanation:** (−3)² = (−3) × (−3) = 9. But −3² = −(3²) = −9 because the exponent applies to 3, not the negative sign.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ee1_translate_expr_001

**Prompt:** Which expression matches the words: "the square of the sum of 2 and 5"?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (2 + 5)² [CORRECT]
- B. 2² + 5² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like each number was squared individually. The phrase says to find the sum *first*, and then square that whole total.
- C. 2 + 5² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems only the 5 was squared. We want to square the *entire* group of 2 plus 5.
- D. (2 + 5) × 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. "Square" means multiplying a number by itself, rather than multiplying by 2.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. (2 + 5)²

**Explanation:** "Sum of 2 and 5" is (2 + 5). "Square of" means square that whole group: (2 + 5)².

### Standard 6.EE.2 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee2_read_expr_001

**Prompt:** Which phrase matches the expression 3x + 5?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Three times a number, then add five [CORRECT]
- B. Three times the sum of a number and five [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That phrase describes 3(x + 5), where the whole group is multiplied. In 3x + 5, only the x is multiplied by 3.
- C. Five times a number, then add three [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the numbers were swapped around from their original places.
- D. Three plus a number, times five [WRONG]
  - Misconception: In this case, that would mean (3 + x) * 5, which is a different calculation.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Three times a number, then add five

**Explanation:** 3x means three times x, then +5 adds five.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee2_eval_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 2a - 7 when a = 6.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 [CORRECT]
- B. 17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like 7 was added to the 12. Double-checking the minus sign will lead to the right result.
- C. -5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the subtraction might have been done in the other direction (7 - 12).
- D. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're halfway there! You found 2a, but don't forget the final step of subtracting that 7.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 5

**Explanation:** Substitute a = 6: 2(6) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee2_power_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate n^2 + 4 when n = 3.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 13 [CORRECT]
