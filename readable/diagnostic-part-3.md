#### Q5 - q_mst_5g3_005

**Prompt:** Which statement best shows category inheritance?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. A square has equal sides, so it cannot be a rectangle. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's natural to think a square is so different that it needs a category of its own. In math, we look at rules—since a square follows all the rules for being a rectangle (plus some extra ones), it still belongs in the rectangle family!
- B. A square is a rectangle, so square properties are exactly the same as all rectangle properties. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. A square definitely has all the basic properties of a rectangle. However, it also has some special "bonus" properties, like having four equal sides, that set it apart from other rectangles.
- C. A square is a rectangle, so it has all rectangle properties plus possible extra properties. [CORRECT]
- D. Categories are unrelated unless the names are similar. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the names were the main focus. In geometry, whether a shape belongs to a category depends on whether it meets the definition, rather than how its name sounds.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. A square is a rectangle, so it has all rectangle properties plus possible extra properties.

**Explanation:** Subcategories inherit all parent-category attributes and may add more.

### Standard 5.G.4 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Classify two-dimensional figures in a hierarchy based on properties.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5g4_001

**Prompt:** Which hierarchy is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Quadrilateral -> Rectangle -> Square [CORRECT]
- B. Square -> Rectangle -> Quadrilateral [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the order was flipped around. In these types of lists, we usually start with the biggest, most general group and then list the more specific groups that fit inside it.
- C. Rectangle -> Triangle -> Square [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is tricky. While rectangles and squares both have four sides, a triangle only has three. That means triangles don't quite fit into this specific family tree.
- D. Square -> Rhombus -> Triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the three-sided triangle was grouped with four-sided shapes. Because their number of sides is different, they belong to different categories.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Quadrilateral -> Rectangle -> Square

**Explanation:** Squares are a type of rectangle, and rectangles are a type of quadrilateral.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5g4_002

**Prompt:** A shape has four equal sides and four right angles. It belongs in which categories?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, quadrilateral [CORRECT]
- B. Square only [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're correct that it's a square! Because a square is a special kind of shape, it also belongs to all of the larger groups it came from, like rectangles and quadrilaterals.
- C. Rectangle and triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like "triangle" was included by mistake. Since this shape has four sides, it belongs in the quadrilateral family instead.
- D. Rhombus only [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It is indeed a rhombus, but it also fits into several other categories in the shape family tree because of its extra properties.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, quadrilateral

**Explanation:** A square is also a rectangle and rhombus, which are parallelograms and quadrilaterals.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5g4_003

**Prompt:** Which statement is always true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. All parallelograms are rectangles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like some specific parallelograms were in mind. Many parallelograms don't have right angles, which means they can't all be called rectangles.
- B. All rectangles are squares [WRONG]
  - Misconception: While squares are a type of rectangle, many rectangles have some sides longer than others. For a rectangle to be a square, all of its sides must be exactly equal.
- C. All squares are rectangles [CORRECT]
- D. All quadrilaterals are rhombuses [WRONG]
  - Misconception: There are many different types of four-sided shapes (like trapezoids) that don't follow the specific rules for being a rhombus.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. All squares are rectangles

**Explanation:** A square meets all rectangle requirements, so every square is a rectangle.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5g4_004

**Prompt:** A shape has exactly one pair of parallel sides. How should it be classified in this hierarchy?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Parallelogram [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is a common mix-up. For a shape to be a parallelogram, it needs to have two pairs of parallel sides, not just one.
- B. Trapezoid (a quadrilateral, but not a parallelogram) [CORRECT]
- C. Rectangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the rule for rectangles was a bit different than expected. Since a rectangle must have two pairs of parallel sides, this shape doesn't quite fit.
- D. Square [WRONG]
  - Misconception: For a shape to be a square, it needs two pairs of parallel sides and four equal sides. This shape only has one pair, so it's a different kind of figure.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Trapezoid (a quadrilateral, but not a parallelogram)

**Explanation:** With exactly one pair of parallel sides, the shape is a trapezoid category.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5g4_005

**Prompt:** Which classification chain is valid for some shapes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Rhombus -> Parallelogram -> Quadrilateral [CORRECT]
- B. Quadrilateral -> Triangle -> Polygon [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! While triangles and quadrilaterals are both types of polygons, a triangle isn't actually a kind of quadrilateral because it doesn't have four sides.
- C. Square -> Rectangle -> Triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like a three-sided shape was added to a group of four-sided shapes. Because their properties are so different, they belong in different hierarchies.
- D. Parallelogram -> Square -> Rectangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. Actually, the order should be flipped for those two—a square is a special type of rectangle, rather than the other way around.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Rhombus -> Parallelogram -> Quadrilateral

**Explanation:** Every rhombus is a parallelogram, and every parallelogram is a quadrilateral.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Data Visualization

- Topic ID: 7.4
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 5.MD.2

### Standard 5.MD.2 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Use operations on fractions for this grade to solve problems involving information presented in line plots.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5md2_001

**Prompt:** A line plot shows ribbon lengths: 1/2 (2 ribbons), 3/4 (3 ribbons), and 1 (1 ribbon). What is the total length?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 1/4 units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It looks like one of the measurements might have been accidentally skipped in the sum. Taking another look at each data point will help.
- B. 4 1/4 units [CORRECT]
- C. 4 units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the totals were rounded slightly. Keeping the exact fractions in each step will lead to a more accurate total.
- D. 2 3/4 units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like some of the ribbons weren't included in the calculation. Adding all the values shown on the plot will give the full length.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4 1/4 units

**Explanation:** Total is 2 x 1/2 + 3 x 3/4 + 1 x 1 = 1 + 2 1/4 + 1 = 4 1/4 units.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5md2_002

**Prompt:** A plot has data points at 5/8, 5/8, 7/8, and 1 1/8. What is the difference between the greatest and least values?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/2 [CORRECT]
- B. 3/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. There might have been a small slip-up while subtracting those fractions. Working with the bottom numbers could help clear things up.
- C. 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's natural to compare nearby points. For this problem, let's look for the very largest and very smallest values to find the full range.
- D. 5/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like one of the values was chosen instead of finding how far apart they are. Subtracting the smallest from the largest will give that distance.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1/2

**Explanation:** Greatest is 1 1/8 and least is 5/8. Difference is 1 1/8 - 5/8 = 6/8 = 3/4? Wait, 1 1/8 - 5/8 = 9/8 - 5/8 = 4/8 = 1/2. Correct.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5md2_003

**Prompt:** A line plot shows 4 measurements: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1. What is the mean measurement?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close! It looks like you found the middle spot between the first and last numbers. To find the "mean," let's try adding all four numbers together and then dividing by 4.
- B. 5/8 [CORRECT]
- C. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. Finding the average of all four points can be tricky—adding them all up first and then dividing will help.
- D. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the largest measurement was picked. Let's try combining all the points and finding the value that sits right in the "center" of their sum.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 5/8

**Explanation:** Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 3/4 + 1 = 2 1/2 = 5/2. Divide by 4 gives 5/8.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5md2_004

**Prompt:** Line plot data: 3/8, 3/8, 3/8, 5/8. If the total is shared equally among 4 items, how much would each get?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is the most common number shown. To share the total equally, we'll need to combine all the values and then divide that total by 4.
- B. 7/16 [CORRECT]
- C. 5/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the largest number was chosen. For equal sharing, we usually look for a value that is somewhere in the middle of all the data.
- D. 1/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! Using the exact fractions for each step instead of rounding will help you find the perfectly accurate average.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7/16

**Explanation:** Total is 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 5/8 = 14/8 = 7/4. Divide by 4 gives 7/16.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5md2_005

**Prompt:** A line plot has measurements: 1/2, 1/2, 3/4, 3/4, 3/4. How much more is the sum of the three 3/4 measurements than the sum of the two 1/2 measurements?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 1/4 [CORRECT]
- B. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It looks like only one of each measurement was compared. If we look at the whole groups of them together, the difference will be a bit larger.
- C. 2 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is a great start—as you found the sum for the first group. The last step is to take away the sum of the other group to find how much more you have.
- D. 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the difference between just one 3/4 and one 1/2 was calculated. If we account for every measurement on the plot, we'll find the full difference.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1 1/4

**Explanation:** Three 3/4 values sum to 9/4. Two 1/2 values sum to 1. Difference is 9/4 - 1 = 5/4 = 1 1/4.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Measurement Conversions & Volume

- Topic ID: 7.7
- Power standards: 5.MD.1, 5.MD.3, 5.MD.4, 5.MD.5

### Standard 5.MD.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to 0.05 m), and use these conversions in solving multi-step, real world problems.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5md1_001

**Prompt:** Convert 3.5 meters to centimeters.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 35 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! It looks like multiplication by 10 was used. In the metric system, there are actually 100 centimeters packed into every single meter.
- B. 350 cm [CORRECT]
- C. 0.35 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to mix them up. Since centimeters are much smaller than meters, it takes many more of them to span the same distance, so the number should get larger.
- D. 3500 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like multiplication by 1000. For meters and centimeters, we multiply by exactly 100.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 350 cm

**Explanation:** 1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 3.5 x 100 = 350 cm.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5md1_002

**Prompt:** Convert 4200 milliliters to liters.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 42 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're on the right track. It seems like the number was divided by 100. In the metric system, we use 1000 to convert between milliliters and liters.
- B. 4.2 L [CORRECT]
- C. 0.42 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like the decimal point was moved four places. For 1000, we move it exactly three places to the left.
- D. 420 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since liters are a larger unit than milliliters, it takes fewer of them to measure the same amount of liquid, so the number should decrease.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4.2 L

**Explanation:** 1000 mL = 1 L. So 4200 mL = 4200 / 1000 = 4.2 L.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5md1_003

**Prompt:** A board is 9 feet long. How many inches long is the board?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 72 in [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close! It seems like the 9 was multiplied by 8. In the standard system, there are 12 inches in every foot.
- B. 96 in [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close. Multiplying the number of feet by 12 will help you find the exact number of inches.
- C. 108 in [CORRECT]
- D. 900 in [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like a factor of 100 was used, as if this were a metric measurement. For feet and inches, multiplying by 12 is the standard rule.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 108 in

**Explanation:** 1 foot = 12 inches, so 9 x 12 = 108 inches.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5md1_004

**Prompt:** A recipe needs 3 cups of broth. You only have a 1-pint measure. How many pints are needed?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 pint [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to mix those two up. Since a pint holds more than a cup, you'll need more than one pint to cover the 3 cups in the recipe.
- B. 1.5 pints [CORRECT]
- C. 2 pints [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! Rounding up to the next whole number is a good estimate, but we can find the exact amount by using the fact that 2 cups equal exactly 1 pint.
- D. 6 pints [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the conversion went in the wrong direction. Since pints are larger than cups, we'll need fewer of them for the same amount of liquid.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1.5 pints

**Explanation:** 1 pint = 2 cups. So 3 cups is 3 / 2 = 1.5 pints.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5md1_005

**Prompt:** A runner completed 2 kilometers and then 350 meters. What is the total distance in meters?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 235 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! There are actually 1000 meters in a kilometer, rather than 100. Adding those 2000 meters to the 350 will help.
- B. 200350 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were listed together side-by-side. Converting the kilometers into meters first and then adding will give the correct total distance.
- C. 2350 m [CORRECT]
- D. 2500 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It seems like the 350 was rounded up slightly before the addition. Using the exact number will give the perfectly accurate result.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 2350 m

**Explanation:** 2 km = 2000 m. Then 2000 + 350 = 2350 m.

### Standard 5.MD.3 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize volume as an attribute of solid figures and understand concepts of volume measurement.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5md3_001

**Prompt:** Which measurement describes volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. How long the shape is [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's a great description of length! Volume is a bit different—it measures the entire amount of space that's filled *inside* the shape.
- B. How much space the solid figure takes up [CORRECT]
- C. How far around the shape is [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This sounds like you might be thinking of "perimeter." Volume is a 3D measurement that looks at the space filled up by the whole shape.
- D. How much surface is on the outside [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! That's a measurement of "surface area." Volume focus on the inside space instead of just the outer shell.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. How much space the solid figure takes up

**Explanation:** Volume measures the amount of 3-dimensional space inside a solid figure.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5md3_002

**Prompt:** Which unit is appropriate for measuring the volume of a box?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. square centimeters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's natural to think of squares. "Square" units are for flat surfaces, but for measuring how much space is *inside* a 3D box, we use "cubic" units.
- B. centimeters [WRONG]
- Misconception: Centimeters are perfect for measuring the length of one edge. Since a box has three dimensions, we need a unit that represents all of that space together.
- C. cubic centimeters [CORRECT]
- D. degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Degrees are used for measuring angles. To find the size of a box, we use units of space instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. cubic centimeters

**Explanation:** Volume is measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5md3_003

**Prompt:** A unit cube has side length 1 cm. What volume does one unit cube represent?

**Visual:** Inline visual HTML present

**Choices:**
- A. 1 square cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. "Square" units describe flat areas. Since this is a solid cube taking up 3D space, we call it a "cubic" centimeter.
- B. 1 cubic cm [CORRECT]
- C. 3 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the three sides were added. For volume, we multiply those dimensions together!
- D. 1 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This measures a simple distance in a straight line. For a shape like a cube, we need a 3D unit like "cubic cm."

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1 cubic cm

**Explanation:** A 1 cm by 1 cm by 1 cm cube has volume 1 cubic centimeter.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5md3_004

**Prompt:** Which statement is true about two solids built from unit cubes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The one with more cubes has greater volume. [CORRECT]
- B. The taller one always has greater volume. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's a common thought! However, a short shape could still have more volume if it's very wide or deep.
- C. Volume depends only on outside shape. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, volume is all about what's on the *inside* and counting exactly how many cubes make it up.
- D. If they have the same height, they must have same volume. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We also have to see how long and wide the shapes are before we can know their total volume.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. The one with more cubes has greater volume.

**Explanation:** With unit cubes, volume is counted by the total number of cubes filling the solid.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5md3_005

**Prompt:** If a prism can be packed exactly by 24 unit cubes, what is its volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 24 cubic units [CORRECT]
- B. 24 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close. "Square units" are for flat surfaces. Since a prism is a solid shape filled with cubes, we use "cubic units."
- C. 12 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the total was cut in half, but every single cube in the box contributes its own piece to the total volume.
- D. 48 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the count was doubled. Counting the cubes exactly as they are will give the right volume.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 24 cubic units

**Explanation:** Volume equals the number of unit cubes that fill the solid, so it is 24 cubic units.

### Standard 5.MD.4 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Measure volumes by counting unit cubes, using cubic cm, cubic in, cubic ft, and improvised units.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5md4_001

**Prompt:** A rectangular prism is built with 3 layers. Each layer has 8 unit cubes. What is the volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 11 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the number of layers and cubes were added together. For volume, we can multiply the layers by the number of cubes in each layer!
- B. 24 cubic units [CORRECT]
- C. 16 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! It seems like only two of the layers were counted. Including that third layer will give the full total.
- D. 32 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close. It looks like an extra layer might have been added by mistake.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24 cubic units

**Explanation:** Count all cubes: 3 layers x 8 cubes per layer = 24 cubic units.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5md4_002

**Prompt:** A box is filled with 18 cubes of 1 cubic inch each. What is its volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 18 cubic inches [CORRECT]
- B. 18 square inches [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. "Square inches" are for flat areas. For the space inside a box, we use "cubic inches" for volume.
- C. 9 cubic inches [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the total was split in half. Every one of those 18 cubes counts toward the total space.
- D. 36 cubic inches [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the count might have been doubled, but we just need to count each cube once.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 18 cubic inches

**Explanation:** Each unit cube is 1 cubic inch, so 18 cubes give 18 cubic inches.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5md4_003

**Prompt:** A prism is 4 cubes long, 2 cubes wide, and 3 cubes high. How many unit cubes fill it?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the three dimensions were added. To find the total amount of space inside, multiplying those dimensions will give the right answer.
- B. 24 [CORRECT]
- C. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close! It looks like only two of the dimensions were multiplied. Including the third one will complete the calculation.
- D. 48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the calculation was doubled. Using the dimensions exactly once will give the correct count.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24

**Explanation:** Count cubes by dimensions: 4 x 2 x 3 = 24 unit cubes.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5md4_004

**Prompt:** A storage cube uses cubic feet as units. If it is filled with 15 unit cubes, what is the volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 15 cubic feet [CORRECT]
- B. 15 feet [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. "Feet" is for measuring simple distance. For volume, we use "cubic feet" as the unit.
- C. 15 square feet [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That fits for a flat area. For something that fills a 3D space, like this storage cube, we use "cubic feet."
- D. 5 cubic feet [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the total was divided. Every one of the cubes represents its own part of the total volume!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 15 cubic feet

**Explanation:** With cubic-foot unit cubes, volume equals the number of cubes: 15 cubic feet.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5md4_005

**Prompt:** Two solids are built from the same size unit cubes. Solid A has 20 cubes. Solid B has 17 cubes. How much greater is the volume of A than B?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 cubic units [CORRECT]
- B. 37 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the two volumes were added. To find how much "greater" one is, subtracting them will give the right number.
- C. 17 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's the volume of just Solid B. We're looking for the difference between the two shapes.
- D. 20 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's just the count for Solid A. Let's find out how much larger it is by taking away the volume of Solid B.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3 cubic units

**Explanation:** Greater volume means subtraction here: 20 - 17 = 3 cubic units.

### Standard 5.MD.5 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Relate volume to the operations of multiplication and addition and solve real world and mathematical problems involving volume.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5md5_001

**Prompt:** Find the volume of a prism with length 6 cm, width 4 cm, and height 3 cm.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 13 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the dimensions were added. For volume, multiplying the length, width, and height together will help!
- B. 24 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It seems only two of the dimensions were used. Multiplying all three will give the full volume.
- C. 72 cubic cm [CORRECT]
- D. 144 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the multiplication down! It looks like the total might have been doubled at the end.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 72 cubic cm

**Explanation:** Volume of a rectangular prism is l x w x h, so 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic cm.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5md5_002

**Prompt:** A tank has base area 18 square feet and height 5 feet. What is its volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 23 cubic ft [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the area and height were added. Multiplying the base area by the height is the best way to find the total volume.
- B. 90 cubic ft [CORRECT]
- C. 90 square ft [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the number exactly right! Since it's a volume, we use "cubic feet" instead of "square feet."
- D. 13 cubic ft [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were subtracted. Multiplying them will lead you to the total space inside.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 90 cubic ft

**Explanation:** Volume = base area x height = 18 x 5 = 90 cubic feet.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5md5_003

**Prompt:** A composite solid is made from two rectangular prisms with volumes 24 cubic units and 18 cubic units. What is the total volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like subtraction was used. To find the "total" volume, adding the two parts together will help!
- B. 42 cubic units [CORRECT]
- C. 432 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Multiplying them was a great try, but for combining shapes, we just need to add their individual volumes.
- D. 24 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's just one piece of the shape. Don't forget to include the volume of the second part!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 42 cubic units

**Explanation:** For non-overlapping parts, total volume is the sum: 24 + 18 = 42 cubic units.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5md5_004

**Prompt:** A shipping crate is 10 in by 6 in by 4 in. How many 1-cubic-inch cubes can fit exactly inside?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're on the right track. It seems only two dimensions were used. Multiplying all three will give the total number of cubes.
- B. 40 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like a couple of the dimensions were multiplied. Using all three (length, width, and height) will lead to the right count!
- C. 240 [CORRECT]
- D. 120 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the final total might have been cut in half.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 240

**Explanation:** The number of 1-cubic-inch cubes equals the prism's volume: 10 x 6 x 4 = 240.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5md5_005

**Prompt:** Two boxes have the same height of 3 cm. Box A base area is 20 sq cm. Box B base area is 14 sq cm. What is the difference in their volumes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You found the difference between the bases, which is a great start! Now, multiplying that difference by the height of 3 cm will give the volume difference.
- B. 18 cubic cm [CORRECT]
- C. 34 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the areas were added. Since we're looking for a difference, subtracting the two volumes will help.
- D. 102 cubic cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like some of the numbers were combined in a way that produced a much larger total.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 18 cubic cm

**Explanation:** Volume difference = (20 x 3) - (14 x 3) = 60 - 42 = 18 cubic cm.

### Standard 6.NS.2 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Fluently divide multi-digit numbers using the standard algorithm.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns2_001

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 372 ÷ 4.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 83 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's a good estimate. It looks like 8 was used instead of 9 for the first part of the division. Finding the largest number that fits into 37 will lead to the correct answer.
- B. 93 [CORRECT]
- C. 90 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! It seems one of the steps was stopped after the first part. Finishing the division with the remaining numbers will give the full result.
- D. 98 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It might help to re-check the subtraction when taking away 36 from 37.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 93

**Explanation:** 4 goes into 37 nine times (9×4=36), leaving remainder 1. Bring down the 2 to make 12, and 12÷4=3, so the quotient is 93.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns2_002

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 4024 ÷ 4.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 106 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to skip over digits. When 4 doesn't go into a number at all, writing a 0 in that spot helps keep everything in the right place value.
- B. 1006 [CORRECT]
- C. 101 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like some of the digits might have been missed while bringing them down. Going slowly, one digit at a time, will keep the calculation steady.
- D. 1001 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. For the final step, let's look at the whole "new" number you formed (24) and see how many times 4 fits into it.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1006

**Explanation:** 4÷4=1, then bring down 0 so 0÷4=0, then bring down 2 so 2÷4=0 remainder 2, then bring down 4 to make 24 and 24÷4=6. The quotient is 1006.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns2_003

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 1512 ÷ 24.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 60 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the first digit down perfectly! To get the final answer, just carry out the rest of the division with the remainder.
- B. 63 [CORRECT]
- C. 61 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. You might want to double-check the subtraction of 151 - 144 to see what number you get!
- D. 66 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like there might have been a small slip-up in the final multiplication step.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 63

**Explanation:** 24 goes into 151 six times (6×24=144), leaving 7. Bring down 2 to make 72, and 72÷24=3, so the quotient is 63.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns2_004

**Prompt:** Use long division to find 1237 ÷ 5. Give the quotient with remainder.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 247 R0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! It looks like there was a tiny subtraction slip-up at the very end. Since 5 times 7 is 35, you'll have 2 left over as the remainder.
- B. 247 R2 [CORRECT]
- C. 254 R3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like some of the digits were brought down too quickly. Taking them one at a time will keep the whole process on track!
- D. 247.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That decimal is spot-on! The question specially asked to write the answer with a "remainder" (like R2) instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 247 R2

**Explanation:** 12÷5=2 remainder 2; bring down 3 to make 23, so 23÷5=4 remainder 3; bring down 7 to make 37, so 37÷5=7 remainder 2. The result is 247 R2.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns2_005

**Prompt:** A student used long division for 306 ÷ 3 and wrote 12. Which answer is the correct quotient?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's very easy to miss that zero in the middle. Even when a number doesn't fit at all, putting a 0 placeholder in the results helps keep the whole answer in the right spot!
- B. 102 [CORRECT]
- C. 112 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like two digits were brought down at once. Dividing them one by one will help keep the answer accurate.
- D. 100 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! It seems like the division was finished just before the last digit. Don't forget that 6 at the end!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 102

**Explanation:** 3 goes into 3 once, then bring down 0 so 0÷3=0, then bring down 6 so 6÷3=2. The correct quotient is 102.

### Standard 6.NS.4 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers less than or equal to 12. Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns4_gcf_swap_small_001

**Prompt:** What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 48?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's a great start and a factor for both! If you keep looking, you'll find an even larger number that fits into both 36 and 48.
- B. 12 [CORRECT]
- C. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: 16 is a factor for 48, but it doesn't quite go into 36 evenly. For a GCF, the number needs to fit into both values!
- D. 144 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like a common multiple was found (a number both can grow into). To find a GCF, we look for the largest factor that fits "inside" both numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 12

**Explanation:** Prime factorize: 36 = 2×2×3×3 and 48 = 2×2×2×2×3. The shared factors are 2×2×3 = 12, so the GCF is 12.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns4_gcf_002

**Prompt:** What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 28 and 42?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're right that they're both even and divisible by 2! But if you check some slightly larger numbers, you'll find an even bigger common factor.
- B. 14 [CORRECT]
- C. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close. 7 is definitely a common factor, but since 14 also works, it's the larger (and greatest) common factor.
- D. 84 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is the least common multiple. For GCF, we want a number that fits *into* both 28 and 42.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 14

**Explanation:** List factors: 28 has factors 1,2,4,7,14,28 and 42 has factors 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. The greatest shared factor is 14.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns4_lcm_swap_001

**Prompt:** What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the GCF was found. For the LCM, we're looking for the smallest number that both 6 and 8 can multiply up into!
- B. 24 [CORRECT]
- C. 48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is a common multiple. Since 24 also works and is smaller, it's considered the *least* common multiple.
- D. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! 12 is a multiple of 6, but it isn't quite a multiple of 8.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24

**Explanation:** Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24… Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24… The first match is 24, so the LCM is 24.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns4_lcm_002

**Prompt:** What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you found the GCF (the largest factor). For the LCM, we want the smallest number that both 9 and 12 can grow into!
