#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee6_word_to_expr_001

**Prompt:** Write an expression for: 'the total points after scoring 4 points per game for g games and then earning 7 bonus points.'

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4g + 7 [CORRECT]
- B. 4(g + 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close! It looks like the bonus was multiplied by 4 along with the games. Usually, a bonus like this is just added once at the very end of all the games!
- C. g + 11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the 4 points per game were added to the 7, but since you get those 4 points for *every* game, we'll need to use multiplication for that part.
- D. 7g + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! It looks like the 7 and the 4 swapped places. Since the 4 points go with each game, those two should be paired together.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 4g + 7

**Explanation:** Points from games are 4g, and bonus adds 7 once, so total is 4g + 7.

### Standard 6.EE.7 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving equations of the form *x* + *p* = *q* and *px* = *q* for cases in which *p*, *q* and *x* are all nonnegative rational numbers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee7_add_eq_001

**Prompt:** Solve: x + 9 = 23

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 14 [CORRECT]
- B. 32 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the two numbers were added together. To find the value of x, we should use the opposite operation and subtract 9 from 23 instead!
- C. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like there was just a tiny slip-up during the subtraction. Let's try 23 - 9 one more time.
- D. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems like the numbers were subtracted in a different order than we need.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 14

**Explanation:** Subtract 9 from both sides: x = 23 - 9 = 14.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee7_mult_eq_001

**Prompt:** Solve: 6x = 42

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7 [CORRECT]
- B. 36 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like subtraction was used. Since the 6 and x are being multiplied, using division is the best way to separate them and find x!
- C. 252 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems both sides were multiplied. To undo the multiplication on the left, let's try dividing 42 by 6.
- D. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It seems like there was just a small arithmetic slip during the division.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 7

**Explanation:** Divide both sides by 6: x = 42/6 = 7.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee7_decimal_eq_001

**Prompt:** Solve: x + 2.5 = 6.1

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3.6 [CORRECT]
- B. 8.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the numbers were added. Remember, to isolate x, we use the opposite of addition and subtract 2.5 from 6.1.
- C. 3.1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like everything was set up correctly, but there was a small error in the subtraction itself.
- D. 2.44 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like division was used instead of subtraction. Since the problem started with addition, subtraction is the way to solve it.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3.6

**Explanation:** Subtract 2.5 from both sides: x = 6.1 - 2.5 = 3.6.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ee7_fraction_eq_001

**Prompt:** Solve: (3/4)x = 6

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8 [CORRECT]
- B. 4.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like multiplication by 3/4 was used. To find x, we actually want to divide by 3/4 (which is the same as multiplying by 4/3)!
- C. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems only the top part of the fraction was used. Don't forget that the 4 on the bottom also plays a role in the calculation.
- D. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like only the bottom number (4) was used. We'll need to use both parts of the fraction to get the right value for x.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 8

**Explanation:** Divide by 3/4, or multiply by 4/3: x = 6 x 4/3 = 8.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee7_word_eq_001

**Prompt:** Three equal packs of markers cost $27. Let x be the cost of one pack. Which equation and solution are correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3x = 27, so x = 9 [CORRECT]
- B. x + 3 = 27, so x = 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since we have three groups that are each the same price, using multiplication (3x) fits the situation better than addition!
- C. 27x = 3, so x = 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems like the relationship was reversed. The 27 is the total cost, and the 3 is how many packs we purchased.
- D. 3x = 27, so x = 30 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the perfect equation! Now, if we divide 27 by 3, we'll find the exact cost of each pack.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3x = 27, so x = 9

**Explanation:** Three packs means 3x. Solving 3x = 27 gives x = 9.

## Module 6: Algebra - Patterns & Relations

- Topic ID: 6.3
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.EE.9

### Standard 6.EE.9 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that change in relationship to one another; write an equation to express one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the other quantity, thought of as the independent variable. Analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using graphs and tables, and relate these to the equation.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ee9_indep_dep_001

**Prompt:** Movie tickets cost $6 each. Let t = number of tickets and c = total cost. Which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Independent: c, Dependent: t [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close! In this case, the total cost depends on how many tickets you decide to buy, so the cost is actually the dependent variable.
- B. Independent: t, Dependent: c [CORRECT]
- C. Independent: 6, Dependent: c [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. The $6 is a fixed price that stays the same. We're looking for the variables that change and affect each other!
- D. Independent: c, Dependent: 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Remember that the cost changes based on the ticket count, which makes the cost the "dependent" part of the pair.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Independent: t, Dependent: c

**Explanation:** You choose how many tickets to buy first, so t is independent. The cost c changes based on t, so c is dependent.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ee9_write_eq_001

**Prompt:** A game gives you 2 bonus points to start, then 3 points for each level you complete. Let x = number of levels and y = total points. Which equation matches the situation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = 3x + 2 [CORRECT]
- B. y = 2x + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the starting bonus and the points per level were swapped. The bonus is the number that stays on its own at the end.
- C. y = 3x − 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since you're being *given* extra points at the start, adding that amount will help show the total score correctly.
- D. y = 3(x + 2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This would mean you get the starting bonus for every single level you play. The bonus only gets added once at the beginning!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. y = 3x + 2

**Explanation:** "3 points per level" means 3x. "2 bonus points to start" is a one-time add-on, so y = 3x + 2.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ee9_table_eq_001

**Prompt:** This table shows how many stickers (y) you have after buying (x) packs. Choose the equation that matches the table.

Table:
x: 0, 1, 2, 3
y: 1, 5, 9, 13

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = 4x + 1 [CORRECT]
- B. y = 4x − 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! You found the right pattern (+4 each time), but let's check the starting point when x is 0 to see what the final constant should be.
- C. y = x + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You noticed that the numbers go up by 4, but we write that as "4x" because it's 4 times the number of packs you buy!
- D. y = 5x + 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the growth rate was just slightly off. Each new pack adds exactly 4 more stickers to the total.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. y = 4x + 1

**Explanation:** Each time x increases by 1, y increases by 4, so the rate is 4. When x = 0, y = 1, so the equation is y = 4x + 1.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ee9_eval_eq_001

**Prompt:** The relationship between x and y is y = 2x + 3. Complete the table value for x = 5.

Table:
x: 1, 2, 5
y: 5, 7, __

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 13 [CORRECT]
- B. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost there! You calculated the 2 x 5 part perfectly. Don't forget that last +3 to find the final total!
- C. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the numbers might have been added before multiplying. Following the order in the rule will help!
- D. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 5 and 3 were added. Remember that 2x means multiplying 2 by your x-value first.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 13

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 5 into the equation: y = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ee9_rate_change_001

**Prompt:** A carnival charges a $4 entry fee plus $2 per ride. Let x = number of rides and y = total cost. The equation is y = 2x + 4. Which statement about how y changes when x increases is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $2. [CORRECT]
- B. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $4. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The $4 is the fee you pay just once to get in. The part that adds on for every ride you take is the $2!
- C. Each time x increases by 1, y doubles. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Adding $2 for each ride is a bit different from doubling the whole price every time.
- D. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $6. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since you only pay the entry fee once, it doesn't get added onto every new ride you take.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. When x increases by 1 ride, y increases by $2.

**Explanation:** In y = 2x + 4, the coefficient 2 tells the rate: $2 per ride. The +4 is the starting cost when x = 0, not the per-ride change.

## Module 6: Algebra - Inequalities & Constraints

- Topic ID: 6.4
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.EE.8

### Standard 6.EE.8 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Write an inequality of the form *x* > *c* or *x* < *c* to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form *x* > *c* or *x* < *c* have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee8_001

**Prompt:** A concert allows only people taller than 140 cm on a ride. If h is height in cm, which inequality matches?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. h < 140 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the symbol is pointing the wrong way. "Taller than" means we're looking for heights that are greater than 140.
- B. h > 140 [CORRECT]
- C. h = 140 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. This would mean they have to be exactly 140 cm, but anyone taller than that can also go on the ride!
- D. h + 140 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This is just a grouping of a letter and a number. We need a comparison symbol like ">" to make it a rule!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. h > 140

**Explanation:** "Taller than 140" means strictly greater, so h > 140.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee8_002

**Prompt:** A package must weigh less than 5 kg. Let w be weight. Which inequality is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. w > 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the symbol is flipped. For "less than 5 kg," we want the weight to be underneath that limit!
- B. w < 5 [CORRECT]
- C. w = 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! But "less than 5" means the weight has to be a smaller number than 5, not exactly 5.
- D. w - 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Inequalities need a special sign to compare the weight to the limit!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. w < 5

**Explanation:** Less than 5 means w < 5.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee8_003

**Prompt:** Which number line description matches x < -2?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Open circle at -2, arrow to the left [CORRECT]
- B. Open circle at -2, arrow to the right [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the arrow is pointing the wrong way. For "less than," we want to show all the smaller numbers waiting on the left!
- C. Closed circle at -2, arrow to the left [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since it's strictly "less than," we use an open circle as a sign that -2 itself is not part of the answer set.
- D. Closed circle at -2, arrow to the right [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with both! We'll need to adjust the circle type and the arrow's direction for this specific rule.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Open circle at -2, arrow to the left

**Explanation:** For x < -2, -2 is not included (open circle) and solutions are smaller values (left).

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ee8_004

**Prompt:** How many solutions does x > 3 have?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! There are actually countless numbers that are larger than 3!
- B. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Unlike regular equations, inequalities represent an entire range of numbers that work.
- C. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the 3 from the question was picked as the answer. There are many more numbers greater than 3 out there!
- D. Infinitely many [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. Infinitely many

**Explanation:** There are endlessly many numbers greater than 3, so the solution set is infinite.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee8_005

**Prompt:** A gym says age must be younger than 16 for junior membership. Let a be age. Which inequality and sample solution are both correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. a > 16, and 14 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the symbol is reversed. "Younger than 16" means the age needs to be less than 16!
- B. a < 16, and 14 is a solution [CORRECT]
- C. a < 16, and 16 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! The inequality part is right, but 16 is not strictly *less than* 16. The age needs to be any number smaller than 16.
- D. a = 16, and 16 is a solution [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. This would only work for one specific age, but many different ages are allowed!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. a < 16, and 14 is a solution

**Explanation:** "Younger than 16" means a < 16, and 14 satisfies that condition.

## Module 6: Algebra - Equivalent Expressions & Factoring

- Topic ID: 6.5
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.EE.3, 6.EE.4

### Standard 6.EE.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee3_001

**Prompt:** Use the distributive property: 4(2 + x) =

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8 + 4x [CORRECT]
- B. 8 + x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the 4 was only multiplied by the 2. Make sure to share that 4 with the x too!
- C. 6x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! However, we can't truly combine 8 and 4x because they aren't "like terms"—it's best to leave them as a sum!
- D. 4x + 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems that the 2 didn't get its share of the 4 from the outside of the parentheses.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 8 + 4x

**Explanation:** Distribute 4 to each term inside parentheses: 4 x 2 + 4 x x = 8 + 4x.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee3_002

**Prompt:** Which factored form is equivalent to 15a + 10?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5(3a + 2) [CORRECT]
- B. 15(a + 10) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! While 15 is a great number, it doesn't quite divide evenly into the 10. We're looking for a number that both 15 and 10 can share!
- C. 10(15a + 1) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the wrong number was picked for the shared factor on the outside.
- D. 5(3a + 5) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! You found the right common factor (5), but if you divide 10 by that 5, you'll get 2 instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 5(3a + 2)

**Explanation:** Both terms share a factor of 5, and 15a + 10 = 5(3a + 2).

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee3_003

**Prompt:** Simplify: y + y + y + 2y

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7y [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like some extra y's might have been counted by mistake. Let's try counting them up one by one!
- B. 5y [CORRECT]
- C. y^4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Adding multiple y's together makes them grow in front (like 3y), while multiplying them would lead to an exponent.
- D. 2y^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the notation! Since we're only adding, the final total stays simple without needing any exponents.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 5y

**Explanation:** Combine like terms by adding coefficients: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5, so 5y.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ee3_004

**Prompt:** Use distributive property with subtraction: 2(5 - n) =

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 10 - 2n [CORRECT]
- B. 10 - n [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like only the 5 was multiplied by 2. Let's make sure the n also gets multiplied by that 2!
- C. 10 + 2n [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Be sure to keep that subtraction sign in its place when you distribute the 2 across the terms.
- D. 7n [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We can't actually combine regular numbers and variables into one term like that.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 10 - 2n

**Explanation:** Distribute 2 to both terms: 2 x 5 and 2 x (-n), giving 10 - 2n.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee3_005

**Prompt:** Which expression is equivalent to 3(x + 4) + 2x?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5x + 12 [CORRECT]
- B. 3x + 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The distribution was a little off—let's try multiplying that 3 by every item inside the group.
- C. 5x + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost there! It looks like the 4 didn't get its turn being multiplied by the 3 on the outside.
- D. 6x + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the 3 only applied to the x, and some other numbers might have gotten mixed in by mistake!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 5x + 12

**Explanation:** 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12, then add 2x: 3x + 12 + 2x = 5x + 12.

### Standard 6.EE.4 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which value is substituted into them).

#### Q1 - q_mst_6ee4_001

**Prompt:** Are the expressions y + y + y and 3y equivalent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Yes, always [CORRECT]
- B. No, never [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Adding something to itself three times is truly exactly the same as multiplying it by 3!
- C. Only when y = 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. For expressions to be "equivalent," they have to match up for any number you can think of!
- D. Only when y = 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: These do match for zero, but they also match perfectly for every other number too!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Yes, always

**Explanation:** y + y + y is three groups of y, which is 3y for any value of y.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6ee4_002

**Prompt:** Are 2(x + 5) and 2x + 10 equivalent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Yes, by distributive property [CORRECT]
- B. No, because one has parentheses [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Even though they look different on the page, the math works out to be identical once you use your distribution rules!
- C. Only for even x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. These will match up perfectly whether x is even, odd, or anything else!
- D. Only for positive x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: These expressions are equivalent for any value, including negative numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Yes, by distributive property

**Explanation:** Distributing 2 gives 2x + 10, so the two expressions are equivalent for all x.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6ee4_003

**Prompt:** Which pair is NOT equivalent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4(a + 1) and 4a + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, these two *are* twins—if you distribute the 4, they match up perfectly!
- B. 5x + 2 and 5(x + 2) [CORRECT]
- C. 3m + 3m and 6m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. These two are truly equivalent because adding 3m and 3m will always result in 6m.
- D. 7 - n and -(n - 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Tricky! If you rewrite the second expression, you'll see they are actually describing the same amount.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 5x + 2 and 5(x + 2)

**Explanation:** 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10, not 5x + 2, so that pair is not equivalent.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6ee4_004

**Prompt:** A student says 3(a + 4) - 2 is equivalent to 3a + 10. Is the student correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Yes [CORRECT]
- B. No, it should be 3a + 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you subtracted before multiplying. Remember to finish the distribution first!
- C. No, it should be 3a + 14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems that 2 was added instead of being subtracted at the end.
- D. No, it should be 12a - 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like some of the pieces got moved around in an unexpected way!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Yes

**Explanation:** 3(a + 4) - 2 = 3a + 12 - 2 = 3a + 10, so it is equivalent.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6ee4_005

**Prompt:** Which method is enough to prove two expressions are equivalent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Check one value of the variable [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Sometimes a single number might work just by luck. To be truly certain, we need a method that works for every number ever!
- B. Check two values of the variable [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Even matching for two numbers doesn't prove they will match for the billions of others out there.
- C. Use properties of operations to transform one expression into the other [CORRECT]
- D. Compare which expression looks longer [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with that! The length of an expression doesn't tell us if it's identical to another one.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Use properties of operations to transform one expression into the other

**Explanation:** Equivalent expressions must match for all allowed values, which is shown by valid algebraic transformations.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Coordinate Geometry

- Topic ID: 7.1
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 6.G.3, 6.NS.8

### Standard 6.G.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6g3_001

**Prompt:** Points A(2,1) and B(2,7) form a vertical segment. What is AB?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like there was a tiny slip-up with the subtraction. Let's try 7 - 1 once more.
- B. 6 [CORRECT]
- C. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems some coordinates were added when we really want to find the gap between them.
- D. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like the x-values were used. Since they're identical, we need to look at the y-values to find the distance between the points.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 6

**Explanation:** Shared x means vertical distance. Subtract y-values: 7 - 1 = 6.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6g3_002

**Prompt:** Points C(4,5) and D(11,5) form a horizontal segment. What is CD?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7 [CORRECT]
- B. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like the subtraction might have been off by just one step.
- C. 16 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It seems the x-values were added together instead of finding the difference between them.
- D. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. That's the y-value that they both share. We're looking for the distance across the x-axis!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 7

**Explanation:** Shared y means horizontal distance. Subtract x-values: 11 - 4 = 7.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6g3_003

**Prompt:** Rectangle vertices are (1,2), (1,6), (5,6), (5,2). What are its side lengths?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4 and 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like some of the source numbers were used directly without finding the gaps between them.
- B. 4 and 4 [CORRECT]
- C. 1 and 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the x-coordinates were chosen instead of finding the actual distance between the points.
- D. 2 and 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the y-coordinates were picked. Let's try finding the length and width by subtracting the numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4 and 4

**Explanation:** Vertical side: 6 - 2 = 4. Horizontal side: 5 - 1 = 4.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6g3_004

**Prompt:** Triangle points are P(3,1), Q(3,5), R(8,5). Which side lengths are correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. PQ = 4 and QR = 5 [CORRECT]
- B. PQ = 2 and QR = 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the distances were counted a bit low. Let's try subtracting those coordinates again.
- C. PQ = 6 and QR = 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems like some of the numbers might have gotten mixed up during the calculation.
- D. PQ = 5 and QR = 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the two numbers were swapped!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. PQ = 4 and QR = 5

**Explanation:** PQ is vertical: 5 - 1 = 4. QR is horizontal: 8 - 3 = 5.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6g3_005

**Prompt:** A square has vertices (2,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,2). What is the perimeter?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Good job finding the side length! Now, for perimeter, we just need to add all four of those sides together.
- B. 20 [CORRECT]
- C. 25 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with those formulas! 25 would be the area of the square. Perimeter is the total distance all the way around the outside.
- D. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like some coordinates were added together. Let's find the lengths of the sides first and combine those instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 20

**Explanation:** Each side is 7 - 2 = 5. Perimeter = 4 x 5 = 20.

### Standard 6.NS.8 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and absolute value to find distances between points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6ns8_quadrant_id_001

**Prompt:** What quadrant is the point (−3, 5) in?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Quadrant I [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Don't forget that negative sign on the 3. Quadrant I is only for points where both of the numbers are positive!
- B. Quadrant II [CORRECT]
- C. Quadrant III [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! Quadrant III is where *both* the x and the y are negative. Our y-value here is a positive 5.
- D. Quadrant IV [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the signs were perhaps thought of in reverse—Quadrant IV has a positive x and a negative y!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Quadrant II

**Explanation:** Quadrant II is where x is negative and y is positive. The point (−3, 5) matches that.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6ns8_coord_move_001

**Prompt:** Start at (−2, 3). Move right 5 units, then down 4 units. What point do you land on?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (−7, −1) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the first move went left instead of right. Moving right means our x-value should be getting larger!
- B. (3, 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the second move went up instead of down. Moving down means the y-value should decrease.
- C. (−6, 8) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like x and y might have been swapped during the process.
- D. (3, −1) [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. (3, −1)

**Explanation:** Right 5 means x: −2 + 5 = 3. Down 4 means y: 3 − 4 = −1, so the point is (3, −1).

#### Q3 - q_cc_6ns8_vert_dist_001

**Prompt:** Point A is (−3, −7) and point B is (−3, −2). What is the distance between A and B?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the numbers were added. To find distance, we want to find the gap between them by subtracting.
- B. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since the x-values match, these points are on a vertical line. Checking the distance between the y-values will help!
- C. 5 [CORRECT]
- D. −5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the change exactly right! Just remember that distance is always a positive number—it tells us "how far," no matter which way we're going.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 5

**Explanation:** The points have the same x, so it's a vertical distance: |−7 − (−2)| = |−5| = 5.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6ns8_horiz_dist_001

**Prompt:** Point C is (−6, 4) and point D is (1, 4). What is the distance between C and D?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems like the numbers were added in a way that didn't show the whole gap. Subtracting the x-values would be a great next step!
- B. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since the y-values are identical, these points are on a perfect horizontal line. Let's check the difference between the two x-values.
- C. −7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! You found the right difference, but remember that distance is always written as a positive value.
- D. 7 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 7

**Explanation:** Same y means horizontal distance: |−6 − 1| = |−7| = 7.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6ns8_total_dist_001

**Prompt:** A treasure map uses a coordinate grid where 1 unit = 1 step. You start at Camp (−5, −2). First you walk straight to the Waterfall at (−5, 4). Then you walk straight to the Treasure at (3, 4). How many steps do you walk in total?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like some numbers were added together. Let's find the steps for each part of the trip individually first and then combine them.
- B. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Good start finding the steps for the first part of the walk! Now, don't forget to include the steps for the second part leading to the Treasure.
- C. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the negatives! When you walk from -5 to 3 on the x-axis, that's a total of 8 steps across.
- D. 14 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 14

**Explanation:** Camp to Waterfall is vertical: |−2 − 4| = 6. Waterfall to Treasure is horizontal: |−5 − 3| = 8. Total 6 + 8 = 14.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Area & 2D Figures

- Topic ID: 7.2
- Power standards: 6.G.1

### Standard 6.G.1 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing into rectangles or decomposing into triangles and other shapes; apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6g1_right_tri_area_001

**Prompt:** A right triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 6 cm (the height is perpendicular to the base). What is its area in cm²?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 48 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you multiplied 8 x 6. Since a triangle is exactly half of a rectangle with those same dimensions, we'll need to divide by 2!
- B. 24 cm² [CORRECT]
- C. 40 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We always want to use the height that's perfectly perpendicular to the base, rather than any slanted sides.
- D. 14 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the operation! Adding the base and height gives a length, but for area, we use multiplication.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24 cm²

**Explanation:** Use A = ½bh. So A = ½ × 8 × 6 = 24 cm².

#### Q2 - q_cc_6g1_nonright_tri_area_001

**Prompt:** A (non-right) triangle has a base of 10 m and a perpendicular height of 7 m. One slanted side is 9 m. What is the area in m²?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 70 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! You multiplied the base and the height, but don't forget that for a triangle, we also have to take half of that total.
- B. 35 m² [CORRECT]
- C. 45 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the slanted side was used for the calculation. We always need the height that's "straight up and down" from the base instead.
- D. 17 m² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Adding the numbers together won't give the area. Multiplying the base and height and then dividing by 2 is the way to go!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 35 m²

**Explanation:** Triangle area is A = ½bh = ½ × 10 × 7 = 35 m².

#### Q3 - q_cc_6g1_trapezoid_area_001

**Prompt:** A trapezoid has bases 6 cm and 10 cm, and height 4 cm (height is the perpendicular distance between the bases). What is its area in cm²?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 64 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It seems the bases might have been used in a different way. The formula for a trapezoid involves finding the average of the two bases first!
- B. 32 cm² [CORRECT]
- C. 240 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like all three numbers were multiplied together. Let's try adding the bases first, then multiplying by the height and dividing by 2!
- D. 20 cm² [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems some of the steps might have been skipped.
