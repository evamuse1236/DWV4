#### Q4 - q_mst_7rp1_liters_min_001

**Prompt:** A faucet runs 2 1/4 liters in 3 minutes. What is the unit rate in liters per minute?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.75 liters per minute [CORRECT]
- B. 1.33 liters per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the division might have been done in reverse. To find liters per minute, we'll want to divide the total liters by the number of minutes!
- C. 6.75 liters per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems multiplication was used instead of division. Let's try dividing that 2.25 liters by 3 to find out how much flows in just one minute.
- D. 2.25 liters per minute [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the units! 2.25 is the total for all 3 minutes combined. We're looking for the unit rate, which is the amount for exactly 1 minute.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 0.75 liters per minute

**Explanation:** Convert 2 1/4 to 2.25 liters. Then divide by 3 minutes: 2.25 ÷ 3 = 0.75 liters per minute.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7rp1_frac_unit_001

**Prompt:** What is the unit rate of 9/10 meter in 3/5 second?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/2 meters per second [CORRECT]
- B. 27/50 meters per second [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the two fractions were multiplied. To find the unit rate (meters per second), we'll need to divide the distance by the time!
- C. 2/3 meters per second [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the ratio was flipped upside down. Let's make sure we're dividing the meters by the seconds to get the right speed!
- D. 6/5 meters per second [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like there was a small error when flipping and multiplying that second fraction. Let's try it again step-by-step.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3/2 meters per second

**Explanation:** Unit rate is (9/10) ÷ (3/5) = (9/10) x (5/3) = 45/30 = 3/2 meters per second.

### Standard 7.RP.2 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7rp2_const_table_001

**Prompt:** In a table, x values are 2, 4, 6 and y values are 5, 10, 15. What is the constant of proportionality k in y = kx?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you found the difference between the numbers. For proportional relationships, we use the ratio of y to x instead!
- B. 2.5 [CORRECT]
- C. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 5 is the first y-value on the table, but we need to see how it relates to its corresponding x-value, which is 2.
- D. 0.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! It seems the ratio was flipped (x/y). Let's try dividing y by x to find the constant k.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 2.5

**Explanation:** For proportional relationships, k = y/x. Using any row: 5/2 = 2.5, 10/4 = 2.5, 15/6 = 2.5.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7rp2_equation_001

**Prompt:** A proportional relationship passes through the point (3, 12). Which equation represents it?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = 3x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the x-value (3) was used as the constant. Let's find k by dividing the y-value by the x-value (12 divided by 3)!
- B. y = 4x [CORRECT]
- C. y = x + 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While 3 + 9 does equal 12, proportional equations always follow the pattern y = kx, with no extra numbers added or subtracted.
- D. y = 12x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! 12 is the y-value for this specific point, but we're looking for the constant multiplier k that connects x to y.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. y = 4x

**Explanation:** k = y/x = 12/3 = 4, so the proportional equation is y = 4x.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7rp2_nonprop_001

**Prompt:** Which table does NOT show a proportional relationship?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. x: 1, 2, 3; y: 4, 8, 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, this one *is* proportional! If you divide y by x in every row, you'll see you get the same answer of 4 every single time.
- B. x: 2, 4, 6; y: 6, 12, 18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. This one is also proportional because the ratio of y to x stays constant at 3 for every pair of numbers.
- C. x: 1, 2, 3; y: 3, 7, 11 [CORRECT]
- D. x: 5, 10, 15; y: 2, 4, 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Even with these smaller numbers, the relationship is proportional since the ratio of y to x is always 0.4.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. x: 1, 2, 3; y: 3, 7, 11

**Explanation:** In a proportional relationship, y/x must be constant. For option C: 3/1 = 3, 7/2 = 3.5, 11/3 is not the same.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7rp2_origin_001

**Prompt:** A graph represents y = 3.5x. Which point must be on the graph?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (0, 3.5) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Remember that all proportional graphs must pass through the origin (0, 0). If x is zero, then y must be zero too!
- B. (2, 7) [CORRECT]
- C. (2, 5.5) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like there was a small slip with the multiplication. Let's try 3.5 times 2 again!
- D. (3.5, 2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the coordinates! It seems the x and y values were swapped. Let's plug 2 in for x and see what y equals.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (2, 7)

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 2 into y = 3.5x: y = 7. So (2, 7) is on the graph.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7rp2_scale_up_001

**Prompt:** If y is proportional to x and y = 14 when x = 4, what is y when x = 10?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 6 was added to both x and y. In proportional problems, we want to find the multiplier rather than just adding!
- B. 35 [CORRECT]
- C. 28 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 28 would be the answer if x had doubled, but x went from 4 to 10. Finding the constant k (y/x) first will help.
- D. 140 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Multiplying 10 by 14 is a big jump. Let's see how y relates to its original x (4) first to find the scaling factor.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 35

**Explanation:** k = y/x = 14/4 = 3.5. Then for x = 10, y = 3.5 x 10 = 35.

## Module 6: Algebra - Solving Equations

- Topic ID: 6.2
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 7.EE.3

### Standard 7.EE.3 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ee3_001

**Prompt:** The temperature was -3.5 degrees in the morning and rose by 7.2 degrees by noon. What was the noon temperature?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3.7 degrees [CORRECT]
- B. -10.7 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the temperature moved the wrong way. Since it "rose" by 7.2, we should be adding to our starting number!
- C. -3.7 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since 7.2 is larger than 3.5, the final temperature should cross zero and end up on the positive side.
- D. 10.7 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the signs! It seems the starting negative sign was missed. Let's start at -3.5 and then add 7.2.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3.7 degrees

**Explanation:** Noon temperature is -3.5 + 7.2 = 3.7 degrees.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ee3_002

**Prompt:** A hiker is at elevation 120 meters. They descend 3 times by 18.5 meters each. What is the final elevation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 64.5 meters [CORRECT]
- B. 175.5 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! To "descend" means you're going down. It looks like those steps were added to 120 instead of subtracted!
- C. 101.5 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It seems only one of the three descents was subtracted. Don't forget to account for all three of them.
- D. -64.5 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While the number is right, the hiker is still high above sea level, so the final elevation should be a positive number.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 64.5 meters

**Explanation:** Total descent is 3 x 18.5 = 55.5. Final elevation = 120 - 55.5 = 64.5.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ee3_003

**Prompt:** A tank has 2 1/4 liters of water. You pour out 3/5 liter and then add 1/2 liter. How much water remains?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 3/20 liters [CORRECT]
- B. 1 3/20 liters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like both numbers were subtracted. Remember, the last step was *adding* water back into the tank!
- C. 2 7/10 liters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems there was a tiny slip-up while finding a common denominator for those fractions.
- D. 1 13/20 liters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the order! It looks like the addition and subtraction steps might have gotten swapped.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2 3/20 liters

**Explanation:** 2 1/4 = 45/20, 3/5 = 12/20, 1/2 = 10/20. Net: 45/20 - 12/20 + 10/20 = 43/20 = 2 3/20.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ee3_004

**Prompt:** A phone plan has a 12 dollar fee plus 0.08 dollars per minute. If the bill is 26.40 dollars, how many minutes were used?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 180 minutes [CORRECT]
- B. 330 minutes [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the $12 fee wasn't subtracted before dividing. We need to take that monthly fee out first!
- C. 145 minutes [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems there might have been a little arithmetic error during the subtraction or the division step.
- D. 14.4 minutes [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the decimals! Dividing by a small number like 0.08 will actually give you a much larger answer than 14.4.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 180 minutes

**Explanation:** Set 12 + 0.08m = 26.40. Then 0.08m = 14.40, so m = 14.40/0.08 = 180.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ee3_005

**Prompt:** You estimate 19.8 / 0.5 to check reasonableness before exact work. Which estimate is best?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. about 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Dividing by 0.5 (which is the same as one-half) actually makes a number *grow*! It's like asking how many halves fit into 20.
- B. about 20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. That would be the answer if we divided by 1, but since 0.5 is even smaller, our result will be larger.
- C. about 40 [CORRECT]
- D. about 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the decimal! Dividing by 0.5 is just like multiplying your original number by 2.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. about 40

**Explanation:** Dividing by one-half is doubling. 19.8 doubles to about 39.6, so about 40.

## Module 6: Algebra - Inequalities & Constraints

- Topic ID: 6.4
- Power standards: 7.EE.4

### Standard 7.EE.4 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ee4_one_step_001

**Prompt:** Solve: x + 8 = -13

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -21 [CORRECT]
- B. 21 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You've got the subtraction down perfect, but remember that a negative number minus more positive numbers stays negative!
- C. -5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems 8 was added to -13. To get x alone, we'll need to *subtract* 8 from both sides instead.
- D. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Take another look at the sign rules when you subtract a positive number from a negative total.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -21

**Explanation:** Subtract 8 from both sides: x = -13 - 8 = -21.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ee4_two_step_001

**Prompt:** Solve: 3x - 5 = 16

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. x = 7 [CORRECT]
- B. x = 11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You did the first step perfectly by adding 5. Now, just don't forget to divide that result by 3!
- C. x = 21 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. After adding 5 to get 21, the final step is to divide by 3 to see what one single x is worth.
- D. x = -7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the signs! Since 3x = 21 and both numbers are positive, our final x should also be positive.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. x = 7

**Explanation:** Add 5 to both sides: 3x = 21. Divide by 3: x = 7.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ee4_neg_coeff_001

**Prompt:** Solve: 4 - 2x = 10

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. x = -3 [CORRECT]
- B. x = 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! You found that 2x should relate to 6, but remember that the coefficient is actually *-2*. We'll need to divide by -2 to get the right sign.
- C. x = -7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Let's re-calculate that subtraction. 10 minus 4 should leave us with 6 before we move on to dividing.
- D. x = 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like x was added by mistake. Let's try to get that -2x term by itself first.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. x = -3

**Explanation:** Subtract 4 from both sides: -2x = 6. Divide by -2: x = -3.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ee4_decimal_coeff_001

**Prompt:** Solve: 0.5x + 3 = 9

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. x = 12 [CORRECT]
- B. x = 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The subtraction was perfect (9 - 3 = 6). Now just remember that dividing 6 by 0.5 is exactly like doubling it!
- C. x = 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We have to finish that subtraction (9 - 3) before we tackle the 0.5 multiplier.
- D. x = 18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems some of the steps got a bit out of order. Let's follow the golden rule of equations: isolate x one step at a time!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. x = 12

**Explanation:** Subtract 3 from both sides: 0.5x = 6. Divide by 0.5: x = 12.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ee4_word_problem_001

**Prompt:** A science quiz has 15 questions. A correct answer gives 2 points and a wrong answer loses 1 point. Kelly scored 21 points and answered every question. How many did she answer correctly?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [CORRECT]
- B. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It seems the wrong answers were counted as zero. Don't forget that each miss *takes away* a point from the total!
- C. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If Kelly only got 9 correct, her score would be even lower once we subtract the points for the 6 she missed.
- D. 13 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the count! If she got 13 correct, her score would be 26 minus 2, which is close but not quite 21.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 12

**Explanation:** Let c be correct and w be wrong. c + w = 15 and 2c - w = 21. Substitute w = 15 - c: 2c - (15 - c) = 21, so 3c = 36 and c = 12.

**Standard Statement:** Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ee1_001

**Prompt:** Simplify: 3(2x - 5) + 4x

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 10x - 15 [CORRECT]
- B. 10x - 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the 3 only multiplied the 2x. Make sure to share that 3 with the 5 as well!
- C. 6x - 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We can't combine -15 and 4x because they aren't "like terms." It's best to keep them separate.
- D. 7x - 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Let's re-add those x's: 6x plus 4x should give us exactly 10x in total.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 10x - 15

**Explanation:** Distribute first: 6x - 15 + 4x, then combine like terms to get 10x - 15.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ee1_002

**Prompt:** Factor completely: 14y + 21

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7(2y + 3) [CORRECT]
- B. 14(y + 21) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While 14 is at the front, it doesn't divide evenly into 21. We're looking for a factor that both 14 and 21 have in common!
- C. 3(14y + 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 3 works perfectly for 21, but it doesn't quite work for 14. Let's try 7 instead!
- D. 7(2y + 21) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! You found the right common factor (7), but don't forget to divide that 21 by 7 too!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 7(2y + 3)

**Explanation:** Greatest common factor is 7, so 14y + 21 = 7(2y + 3).

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ee1_003

**Prompt:** Simplify: -2(3a - 4) + 5(a - 1)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -a + 3 [CORRECT]
- B. -a - 13 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Watch out for those minus signs. Remember that a negative times a negative (like -2 times -4) turns into a positive!
- C. a + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems there was a tiny sign error when combining -6a and 5a. Let's check that math once more.
- D. 11a - 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We need to fully distribute the numbers into the groups before we can start adding up all the a's.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -a + 3

**Explanation:** -2(3a - 4) = -6a + 8 and 5(a - 1) = 5a - 5. Adding gives -a + 3.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ee1_004

**Prompt:** Which expression is equivalent to 0.5(8x - 6) - 1.5x?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2.5x - 3 [CORRECT]
- B. 2.5x + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the -3 accidentally became a +3. Let's keep that subtraction sign through to the final answer.
- C. 5.5x - 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. When you have 4x and subtract 1.5x, you should end up with a smaller number of x's!
- D. 4x - 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with all the pieces! It seems some steps might have been skipped or mixed together. Let's take it one step at a time.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2.5x - 3

**Explanation:** 0.5(8x - 6) = 4x - 3. Then 4x - 3 - 1.5x = 2.5x - 3.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ee1_005

**Prompt:** Simplify and factor: 12m - 18 + 6m

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6(3m - 3) [CORRECT]
- B. 6(2m - 3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like only the first 12m was used. We should combine 12m and 6m into 18m *before* we start our factoring!
- C. 3(6m - 6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While this math is correct, we can pull out even more than a 3! Let's find the *greatest* common factor.
- D. 18m - 18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You simplified the expression perfectly! Now, for the very last step, see if you can pull out a common factor from both 18m and 18.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 6(3m - 3)

**Explanation:** First combine to 18m - 18, then factor out 6: 6(3m - 3).

### Standard 7.EE.2 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities in it are related.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ee2_001

**Prompt:** A gym charges 12 dollars monthly plus 3 dollars per class. Which expression shows total cost for c classes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 + 3c [CORRECT]
- B. 15c [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This would mean the $12 fee repeats for every class you take. The $12 is a one-time monthly fee!
- C. 3(12 + c) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. This would multiply the $12 fee by 3. We only want the 3 multiplied by the number of classes (c).
- D. 12c + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the fee and the per-class price got swapped in their spots.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 12 + 3c

**Explanation:** Fixed fee is 12 and variable fee is 3 per class, so total is 12 + 3c.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ee2_002

**Prompt:** Which rewrite best shows that 3(x + 2) + x has a common factor?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4x + 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the 3 didn't quite get multiplied by the 2 inside the parentheses. Let's try distributing that 3 again!
- B. 4x + 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You simplified it perfectly! Now, for one more step, see if you can find a common number to pull out of both 4 and 6.
- C. 2(2x + 3) [CORRECT]
- D. x(3 + 2) + x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the factoring! It looks like some variables were pulled out that didn't quite belong.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 2(2x + 3)

**Explanation:** 3(x + 2) + x = 3x + 6 + x = 4x + 6 = 2(2x + 3).

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ee2_003

**Prompt:** A store gives 20% discount on an item priced p dollars, then adds 5 dollars shipping. Which equivalent expression for final cost is most useful?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. p - 0.2p + 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This math is definitely correct! We're just looking for the *most* simplified version, like using 0.8p to show the discount.
- B. 0.8p + 5 [CORRECT]
- C. 1.2p + 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 1.2p would actually mean the price went *up* by 20%. For a discount, we want to subtract 20% from the whole.
- D. 0.8(p + 5) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This would take 20% off the shipping price too. The discount only applies to the item itself.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0.8p + 5

**Explanation:** After 20% off, pay 80% of p, then add fixed shipping: 0.8p + 5.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ee2_004

**Prompt:** Two plans are given: Plan A costs 6n + 18, Plan B costs 3(2n + 6). What is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Plan A is always cheaper [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! If you look really closely at Plan B, you'll see it actually simplifies to be exactly the same as Plan A!
- B. Plan B is always cheaper [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If you distribute that 3 in Plan B... surprise! It's identical to Plan A.
- C. The plans are equivalent for all n [CORRECT]
- D. They are equal only when n = 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! While they *are* equal at zero, they'll stay perfectly equal no matter what number you pick for n.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. The plans are equivalent for all n

**Explanation:** Plan B expands to 6n + 18, exactly the same as Plan A.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ee2_005

**Prompt:** Which rewrite best shows the relationship between perimeter P and side s for a square plus 8 extra units: P = 4s + 8?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. P = 4(s + 2) [CORRECT]
- B. P = s + 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Since it's a square, we have to make sure to count all four sides (4s) in the total.
- C. P = 8s + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the number of sides and the bonus units might have swapped places.
- D. P = 2(2s + 8) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! If you multiply that out, you'd get 4s + 16, which is a bit different from our original rule!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. P = 4(s + 2)

**Explanation:** Factoring 4 from 4s + 8 gives 4(s + 2), showing each side effectively has +2.

**Standard Statement:** Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric figures, including computing actual lengths and areas from a scale drawing and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g1_map_len_001

**Prompt:** A map uses a scale of 1:45,000. How long on the map is a road that is 900 meters in real life? (Give answer in cm.)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 cm [CORRECT]
- B. 20 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like one of the zeros might have slipped when converting meters to centimeters. Let's try that conversion one more time.
- C. 0.2 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems there was an extra divide-by-ten. Dividing 90,000 by 45,000 should give us exactly 2!
- D. 4.5 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It's important to change the 900 meters into centimeters *before* you apply the map scale.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2 cm

**Explanation:** 900 m = 90,000 cm in real life. At 1:45,000 scale, map length = 90,000 ÷ 45,000 = 2 cm.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g1_actual_len_001

**Prompt:** A scale drawing uses 1 cm to represent 500 cm. If a segment is 7.2 cm on the drawing, what is the actual length in meters?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 36 m [CORRECT]
- B. 3.6 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like an extra divide-by-10 happened when changing centimeters into meters. Let's re-verify that step.
- C. 0.36 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Remember that 100 cm makes a meter. It looks like 1,000 was used for the conversion instead!
- D. 14.4 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the multiplier! We need to multiply our drawing size by the full 500 to find the actual real-world length.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 36 m

**Explanation:** Actual length is 7.2 x 500 = 3600 cm. Convert to meters: 3600 cm = 36 m.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g1_rescale_001

**Prompt:** A segment is 6 cm long on a 1:20 scale drawing. The same real segment is redrawn at a 1:30 scale. What is the new drawing length?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4 cm [CORRECT]
- B. 9 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Since the new scale (1:30) is "smaller" than the old one, the drawing itself should shrink!
- C. 10 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Scale problems work with multiplication and division, rather than just adding on the difference between the scale numbers.
- D. 3 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Let's find the real-life length first (120 cm) and then see how many 30-cm pieces fit into it!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 4 cm

**Explanation:** At 1:20, 6 cm represents 120 cm actual. At 1:30, drawing length is 120 ÷ 30 = 4 cm.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g1_area_scale_001

**Prompt:** A rectangle on a drawing measures 3 cm by 5 cm at scale 1:100. What is its actual area in square meters?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1500 m^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the scale was applied to the area only once. For area calculations, we have to scale *both* the length and the width!
- B. 15 m^2 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.15 m^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems there was a tiny slip with the zeros when converting from cm² to m².
- D. 150 m^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with those zeros! Let's check the area again after we've changed each of the side lengths from centimeters to meters.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 15 m^2

**Explanation:** Actual side lengths are 300 cm and 500 cm, which are 3 m and 5 m. Area = 3 x 5 = 15 m^2.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g1_scale_compare_001

**Prompt:** Which scale produces the larger drawing of the same real object?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1:80 [CORRECT]
- B. 1:120 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It's actually the other way: a smaller number on the bottom means each drawing unit represents *less* real space, which keeps the drawing larger!
- C. Both produce the same drawing size [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Different scale ratios will always results in different sized drawings for the same real item.
- D. Cannot be determined [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We can definitely tell: the scale that reduces the object less (1:80) will always give you a bigger drawing.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1:80

**Explanation:** For the same real object, 1:80 gives a larger drawing than 1:120 because each 1 drawing unit represents less real distance.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Area & 2D Figures

- Topic ID: 7.2
- Power standards: 7.G.4

### Standard 7.G.4 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g4_area_diameter_001

**Prompt:** A circular clock has diameter 40 cm. What is its area to the nearest ten square centimeters?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. About 1,260 cm^2 [CORRECT]
- B. About 2,510 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the whole diameter was used instead of the radius. Remember that radius is just *half* of the diameter!
- C. About 630 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems like the final area might have been cut in half by mistake. Let's try squaring that 20 cm radius first!
- D. About 125 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That result looks more like circumference. For area, we need to use PI times the radius *squared*!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. About 1,260 cm^2

**Explanation:** Radius is 20 cm. Area is pi x 20^2 = 400pi about 1256.6, which rounds to 1,260 cm^2.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g4_circumference_001

**Prompt:** Find the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm. (Use pi = 22/7.)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 44 cm [CORRECT]
- B. 154 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That value is actually the area of the circle. For circumference, we want 2 times PI times the radius!
- C. 22 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the "2" was missed in our formula. Remember: Circumference = 2πr!
- D. 14 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with those formulas! 14 is the diameter, but we still need to multiply it by PI to get the distance all the way around.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 44 cm

**Explanation:** Circumference is C = 2pi r = 2 x (22/7) x 7 = 44 cm.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g4_diameter_from_c_001

**Prompt:** A circle has circumference 31.4 cm. What is its diameter? (Use pi = 3.14.)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 10 cm [CORRECT]
- B. 5 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! 5 is the radius. The question specifically asks for the diameter, which is twice as long as the radius!
- C. 9.99 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: So close! It looks like there was a small rounding error during the work. 31.4 / 3.14 should give us exactly 10.
- D. 100 cm [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with that decimal point! When you divide 31.4 by 3.14, the answer is 10, not 100.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 10 cm

**Explanation:** Since C = pi d, diameter is d = C/pi = 31.4/3.14 = 10 cm.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g4_area_radius_001

**Prompt:** Find the area of a circle with radius 3.5 cm. (Use pi = 22/7.)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 38.5 cm^2 [CORRECT]
- B. 22 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the radius squared (r²) was missed. For area, we need to multiply PI by the radius *twice*!
- C. 77 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the diameter was squared instead of the radius. Let's stick with our 3.5 cm radius for the calculation.
- D. 24.5 cm^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That result looks more like circumference. For area, we definitely want to use the πr² formula!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 38.5 cm^2

**Explanation:** Area is A = pi r^2 = (22/7) x (3.5)^2 = (22/7) x 12.25 = 38.5 cm^2.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g4_formula_choice_001

**Prompt:** Which expression gives the area of a circle with diameter d?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. pi d [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That's the formula to find the distance *around* the circle (circumference). For the space *inside* (area), we need the radius squared!
- B. pi d^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We want to square only the radius, not the entire diameter. So we'll need to cut d in half before we square it.
- C. pi(d/2)^2 [CORRECT]
- D. 2pi(d/2)^2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with that extra "2"! The area formula is just PI times the radius squared.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. pi(d/2)^2

**Explanation:** Area uses radius squared: A = pi r^2. Since r = d/2, A = pi(d/2)^2.

### Standard 7.G.6 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g6_001

**Prompt:** Find area of a triangle with base 10 and height 7.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 35 square units [CORRECT]
- B. 70 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 70 is the area of a rectangle. Since this is a triangle, we need to take exactly half of that!
- C. 17 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the base and height were added. For area, we want to use multiplication instead!
- D. 24.5 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like there was a little slip in the math. Let's try 10 times 7, then cut that in half.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 35 square units

**Explanation:** Triangle area is 1/2 x base x height = 1/2 x 10 x 7 = 35.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g6_002

**Prompt:** A prism has l = 5, w = 4, h = 3. What is its volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Only two of the numbers were multiplied. To find the volume of a box, we need to multiply all three!
- B. 60 cubic units [CORRECT]
- C. 47 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! It seems some calculations from surface area might have gotten mixed in here!
- D. 120 cubic units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like the volume might have been doubled. 5 x 4 x 3 should give us 60.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 60 cubic units

**Explanation:** Volume V = l x w x h = 5 x 4 x 3 = 60.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g6_003

**Prompt:** A cube has side 4. What is its surface area?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 64 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That's the volume of the cube. For surface area, we want to find the area of *one* face and then multiply it by 6!
- B. 96 square units [CORRECT]
- C. 16 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! 16 is the area of just one face. Since a cube has 6 identical faces, we need to multiply that by 6!
- D. 24 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like the side (4) was multiplied by 6. We first need to square the side to find the area of one face!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 96 square units

**Explanation:** Each face has area 4^2 = 16. There are 6 faces, so total area is 6 x 16 = 96.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g6_004

**Prompt:** A composite figure is made of two 3x3 squares joined together. What is the total area?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 18 square units [CORRECT]
- B. 9 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That's only the area of one of the squares. Don't forget to add in the second square too!
- B. 12 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! It seems the sides were added together. Let's find the area of each square (3x3) and then combine them!
- C. 36 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the total was doubled. Two 9-unit squares joined together makes 18 in total.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 18 square units

**Explanation:** Each square has area 3 x 3 = 9. Two such squares have area 9 + 9 = 18.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g6_005

**Prompt:** A box without a lid has floor 4x5 and height 2. What is the total surface area?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 56 square units [CORRECT]
- B. 76 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you included the top lid! We only want to count the 4 sides and the 1 bottom floor.
- C. 40 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! 40 is the volume. For surface area, we need the total amount of "paint" needed to cover all the outside faces!
- D. 20 square units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That's only the area of the bottom floor. We still need to add up the areas of those 4 walls!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 56 square units

**Explanation:** Floor is 4 x 5 = 20. Two sides are 4 x 2 = 8 each. Two other sides are 5 x 2 = 10 each. Total = 20 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 56.
