#### Q5 - q_mst_6g2_005

**Prompt:** If a prism has dimensions 3/4, 2, and 2/3, which formula gives its volume?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (3/4) + 2 + (2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! For volume, we should be multiplying those dimensions together instead of adding them!
- B. (3/4) x 2 x (2/3) [CORRECT]
- C. 2 x (3/4 + 2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the way the numbers are grouped was changed a bit. Let's remember to multiply all three lengths together!
- D. (3/4) x (2/3) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like one of the dimensions was left out. To find the volume, we'll need all three: length, width, and height.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (3/4) x 2 x (2/3)

**Explanation:** For a rectangular prism, V = l x w x h, so multiply all three edge lengths.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Data Visualization

- Topic ID: 7.4
- Power standards: 6.SP.4
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 6.SP.4 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots.

#### Q1 - q_cc_6sp4_dotplot_mode_001

**Prompt:** A dot plot shows how many pages students read in one night. Each dot is 1 student.

2 pages: ●●
3 pages: ●●●●
4 pages: ●●●
5 pages: ●
6 pages: ●●

Which number of pages is the most common (the mode)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you picked the largest number of pages on the list. The mode is actually the value that has the *most dots* on top of it!
- B. 4 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the dots for 3 and 4 pages might have been mixed up. We're looking for the page count with the tallest stack of dots.
- C. 3 pages [CORRECT]
- D. 5 pages [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! While 5 is a unique value, for the mode, we want the number that shows up most often (the one with the most dots).

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 3 pages

**Explanation:** The most common value is the one with the most dots. "3 pages" has 4 dots, which is more than any other value.

#### Q2 - q_cc_6sp4_histogram_at_least_001

**Prompt:** A histogram groups the number of minutes students practiced piano. The bins are written as: 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39 (so 10–19 includes 10 through 19).

0–9: 5 students
10–19: 7 students
20–29: 6 students
30–39: 2 students

How many students practiced at least 20 minutes?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like only the 20–29 group was counted. Don't forget that "at least 20" also includes those students in the 30–39 group!
- B. 8 students [CORRECT]
- C. 15 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems some students from the 10-19 group might have been included, but "at least 20" means only those who hit 20 minutes or higher.
- D. 20 students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the labels! It looks like the bin numbers themselves (20 and 39) were added. We should be adding up the number of students in those bins instead!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 8 students

**Explanation:** "At least 20 minutes" includes the 20–29 bin and the 30–39 bin. Add their frequencies: 6 + 2 = 8.

#### Q3 - q_cc_6sp4_boxplot_median_001

**Prompt:** A box plot for quiz scores has this 5-number summary:
Min = 10, Q1 = 14, Median = 16, Q3 = 20, Max = 24
What is the median score?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 14 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 14 is actually the Q1 value. In our list of numbers, the median is the value that sits right in the middle, which is 16!
- B. 16 [CORRECT]
- C. 20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 20 is the Q3 value from the summary. We're looking for the median, which represents the middle of the whole group.
- D. 17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like Q1 and Q3 were averaged together. Our summary actually already gives us the median as 16, so no extra math is required!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 16

**Explanation:** In a 5-number summary, the median is explicitly listed as the middle value. Here, the median is 16.

#### Q4 - q_cc_6sp4_choose_plot_001

**Prompt:** A school collected heights (in cm) from 240 students. The teacher wants to see how many students fall in ranges like 130–139, 140–149, 150–159, and so on. Which plot type is the best choice?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Dot plot [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, with 240 students, a dot plot would have so many dots it might be hard to read! Using a histogram would group those students into clear ranges for us.
- B. Histogram [CORRECT]
- C. Box plot [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. A box plot is fantastic for seeing a summary, but it doesn't show exactly how many people are in each specific height range like a histogram can.
- D. Dot plot and box plot are equally best [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Each plot has its own special purpose! For viewing data in grouped intervals or "bins," a histogram is usually the best choice.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Histogram

**Explanation:** A histogram is best when you want counts in intervals (bins) like 130–139 or 140–149, especially with lots of data.

#### Q5 - q_cc_6sp4_histogram_bins_001

**Prompt:** A histogram uses bins 10–19, 20–29, 30–39. A student says: "A value of 20 belongs in the 10–19 bin because it's close to 19." Which statement is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. "20 belongs in 10–19 because bins overlap." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! In a well-made histogram, the bins never overlap. This helps ensure that every number has just one exact home and isn't counted twice!
- B. "20 belongs in 20–29 because 10–19 stops at 19." [CORRECT]
- C. "20 belongs in both 10–19 and 20–29." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. That would mean we're double-counting the number 20. Each piece of data should go into only one single bin!
- D. "20 belongs in 30–39 because you round 20 up." [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We don't need any rounding rules here. Histograms use the exact range of a bin to decide where each number fits!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. "20 belongs in 20–29 because 10–19 stops at 19."

**Explanation:** Bin labels are boundaries. The bin 10–19 includes 10 through 19, so 20 is the first value in the 20–29 bin.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Statistical Inference

- Topic ID: 7.5
- Power standards: 6.SP.1, 6.SP.2
- Challenge standards: 6.SP.3, 6.SP.5

### Standard 6.SP.1 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize a statistical question as one that anticipates variability in the data related to the question and accounts for it in the answers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6sp1_stat_question_001

**Prompt:** Which is a statistical question?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. How many letters are in my first name? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This question only has one single right answer. A statistical question needs to have many possible different answers from a group!
- B. What are the shoe sizes of students in this class? [CORRECT]
- C. What is 8 x 7? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. This is a math fact with only one exact answer. We're looking for a question where the data changes from person to person!
- D. What day is today? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since today is just one specific day for everyone, there's no variability there to study.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. What are the shoe sizes of students in this class?

**Explanation:** A statistical question expects variability in responses. Shoe sizes differ across students.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6sp1_variability_001

**Prompt:** Why is 'How many minutes do students spend on homework each night?' a statistical question?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Because every student will have the same answer. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, it's the other way around! A statistical question is special because we expect students to have *varying* answers from each other!
- B. Because it anticipates different values from different students. [CORRECT]
- C. Because it can be answered without collecting data. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, to answer this correctly, we'd definitely need to go and collect some fresh data from a group of students!
- D. Because it has exactly one correct number. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! If there were only one right number, we wouldn't have any "variability" to analyze!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Because it anticipates different values from different students.

**Explanation:** Statistical questions involve a population and naturally varied answers.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6sp1_nonstat_001

**Prompt:** Which question is NOT statistical?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. How tall are the trees in this park? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since trees in a big park will all be different heights, this is actually a great statistical question!
- B. How many books did each student read this month? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Because every student will likely have read a different number of books, this one is statistical too!
- C. What is the height of this specific tree? [CORRECT]
- D. What are the daily high temperatures this week? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since the high temperature changes on different days, this question involves variability and is statistical.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. What is the height of this specific tree?

**Explanation:** A non-statistical question asks for one fixed value, like one specific tree's height.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6sp1_data_set_001

**Prompt:** A class wants to study variability. Which question is best?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. What is the color of this one student's backpack? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This only looks at one individual. To study variability, we'll need a question that surveys a whole group of people or items!
- B. How many siblings do students in this class have? [CORRECT]
- C. What is the classroom number? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since there's only one classroom number, we won't find any variability to analyze there.
- D. What is 100 divided by 4? [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This is a calculation with one exact result, not a question designed for collecting a set of varied data.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. How many siblings do students in this class have?

**Explanation:** To study variability, ask a question that will produce different answers across many students.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp1_rewrite_001

**Prompt:** Which rewrite turns a non-statistical question into a statistical one?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. From 'How old am I?' to 'How old are students in Grade 6?' [CORRECT]
- B. From 'What is my shoe size?' to 'What is my shoe size exactly?' [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This still only asks about one person. A statistical question needs to ask about a larger group where the answers will be different.
- C. From 'What is the class number?' to 'What is the class number today?' [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Even if you pick a specific day, there's still only one classroom number for the whole class!
- D. From 'What is 5 + 7?' to 'What is 5 + 7 quickly?' [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This is still a math problem with just one right answer, no matter how fast you can solve it!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. From 'How old am I?' to 'How old are students in Grade 6?'

**Explanation:** Statistical rewrites move from one individual/fixed answer to a group where values vary.

### Standard 6.SP.2 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6sp2_center_001

**Prompt:** Data set: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which value is the median (a center measure)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You found a number near the middle, but for the median, we want the number that sits in the very center of our ordered list!
- B. 5 [CORRECT]
- C. 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 6 is just past the middle point. Let's look for the one number that splits the list perfectly in half.
- D. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! 7 is the highest number in the group. We're searching for the median, which is a key measure of the center!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 5

**Explanation:** When data are ordered and count is odd, the median is the middle value. Here it is 5.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6sp2_spread_001

**Prompt:** Data set: 8, 10, 13, 15. What is the range (a spread measure)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you found the difference between the middle numbers. For the range, we want the biggest number minus the smallest one!
- B. 7 [CORRECT]
- C. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 15 is our maximum value, but the range tells us the total distance or "spread" from the very bottom to the very top!
- D. 11.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That value looks like a measure of center. Range is all about measuring how spread out the data points are from each other.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7

**Explanation:** Range = maximum - minimum = 15 - 8 = 7.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6sp2_shape_001

**Prompt:** A dot plot has most values clustered near 20, with a few much larger values near 40. How is this shape best described?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Roughly symmetric [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, if it were symmetric, it would look pretty balanced on both sides. Those extra points out at 40 make it look like it's being stretched!
- B. Skewed right [CORRECT]
- C. Skewed left [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! Since the long "tail" of the data is pointing toward the larger numbers on the right side, we call it skewed right!
- D. Uniform [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Uniform would mean the dots are spread out perfectly evenly. Here, they're mostly gathered together with a few outliers.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Skewed right

**Explanation:** Most data are low with a tail to higher values, which is a right-skewed distribution.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6sp2_compare_spread_001

**Prompt:** Set A: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. Set B: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. Which statement is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Both sets have the same center and same spread. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While they both have the same center (10), Set B is definitely more spread out since the numbers aren't all the same!
- B. Both sets have center 10, but Set B has greater spread. [CORRECT]
- C. Set A has greater spread because all values are 10. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since all the numbers in Set A are identical, it actually has zero spread! Set B has much more variety.
- D. Set B has center 12 and smaller spread. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! The center of Set B is actually 10, and it's much more spread out than Set A is.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Both sets have center 10, but Set B has greater spread.

**Explanation:** Both centers are 10, but Set A range is 0 while Set B range is 8, so Set B is more spread out.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp2_distribution_desc_001

**Prompt:** Which description correctly uses center, spread, and shape?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Center is where most data lie, spread is how far values vary, and shape describes pattern of distribution. [CORRECT]
- B. Center is always the largest value, spread is always zero, and shape is not useful. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like those definitions got mixed up. Center, spread, and shape are all very helpful tools for understanding our data!
- C. Center and spread are the same thing. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Center tells us where the middle of the group is, while spread tells us how far away the other numbers are from that middle point!
- D. Shape is only for geometry, not data. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with that! In statistics, "shape" is actually a very important way to describe how data values are clustered together.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Center is where most data lie, spread is how far values vary, and shape describes pattern of distribution.

**Explanation:** Data distributions are summarized by center (typical value), spread (variability), and shape (pattern).

### Standard 6.SP.3 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number.

#### Q1 - q_mst_6sp3_001

**Prompt:** Which is a measure of center?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Mean [CORRECT]
- B. Range [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The range actually tells us how spread out all the data is, instead of finding the middle point!
- C. Interquartile range [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. The interquartile range is a way to measure variability, or how much the data fluctuates.
- D. Mean absolute deviation [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! This measures how far data points tend to be from the mean, so it's a measure of variation rather than the center.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Mean

**Explanation:** Measures of center include mean and median. Range, IQR, and MAD are spread measures.

#### Q2 - q_mst_6sp3_002

**Prompt:** Which quantity best describes how far data values tend to be from the mean?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Median [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Median is a measure of center. We're looking for a special value that tells us about the "spread" or gap between points!
- B. Mean absolute deviation [CORRECT]
- C. Mode [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Mode just tells us which single value shows up most often, not about the distances between numbers.
- D. Total sum [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Adding everything up tells us the total value, but it doesn't describe how far apart the numbers are from each other.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Mean absolute deviation

**Explanation:** MAD summarizes average distance from the mean, a measure of variation.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6sp3_003

**Prompt:** Data Set A and B both have mean 20. Set A values are tightly clustered near 20, Set B values are widely spread. What is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Both center and variation are the same [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While the centers (means) match, the data in Set B is spread out much further, which means the variation is different!
- B. Center is same, variation is different [CORRECT]
- C. Variation is same, center is different [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We know the means are both 20, so the center is the same—it's the "spread" or variation that differs!
- D. Neither center nor variation can be compared [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We actually have all the information we need here to see that the center matches while the variation does not.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Center is same, variation is different

**Explanation:** Both sets have the same center (mean 20), but different spread.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6sp3_004

**Prompt:** For data 4, 6, 8, which statement is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Mean is 6 and range is 4 [CORRECT]
- B. Mean is 4 and range is 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like those two values were swapped. 6 is our average (mean) and 4 is the total gap (range)!
- C. Mean is 6 and range is 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like the range was only measured between neighbors. For the real range, just use the max minus the min (8 - 4).
- D. Mean is 8 and range is 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with your centers! 8 is our largest number, but for the mean, we want the average of the whole group!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Mean is 6 and range is 4

**Explanation:** Mean = (4 + 6 + 8)/3 = 6. Range = 8 - 4 = 4.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp3_005

**Prompt:** Why is it useful to report both a measure of center and a measure of variation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Because center alone describes everything about a data set [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, center is great for found the middle, but it doesn't give us any clues about whether the data is gathered together or spread way out!
- B. Because variation alone gives the typical value [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Variation tells us how spread out things are, but we need the center to find the "typical" or middle result!
- C. Because center shows a typical value and variation shows how values differ around it [CORRECT]
- D. Because both numbers are always equal [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Center and variation are actually two different ways of analyzing data, so they are almost never exactly the same!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Because center shows a typical value and variation shows how values differ around it

**Explanation:** Center summarizes location; variation summarizes spread. Both are needed to describe a distribution.

### Standard 6.SP.5 (Grade 6) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context, such as by:

#### Q1 - q_mst_6sp5_001

**Prompt:** A report says: 'Class average height is 152.' What key context detail is missing?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Units of measurement [CORRECT]
- B. A color for the graph [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While colors catch the eye, they don't change what the data actually means. We need to know if 152 is cm, inches, or something else!
- C. Whether the average is an integer [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Whether it's a whole number or not is much less important than knowing what's being measured!
- D. A second decimal place [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the details! More decimals might add precision, but knowing the units (like cm) is the most critical part here.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Units of measurement

**Explanation:** A meaningful summary must include units (for example, centimeters).

#### Q2 - q_mst_6sp5_002

**Prompt:** Which item is a quantitative measure of variability?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Median [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Median is a measure of center. We're looking for a special measure that tells us how much the data varies or spreads apart.
- B. Interquartile range [CORRECT]
- C. Mode [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Mode just tells us which value appears most often, not about the overall spread of the whole data set!
- D. Sample size [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Sample size only tells us how many pieces of data we collected, not how much those pieces differ from each other.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Interquartile range

**Explanation:** IQR and MAD are variability measures used to summarize spread.

#### Q3 - q_mst_6sp5_003

**Prompt:** Data are test scores: 71, 73, 72, 74, 95. Which statement best summarizes shape and deviations?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. All scores are clustered near 73 with one high outlier-like value 95 [CORRECT]
- B. Scores are perfectly symmetric with no unusual values [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Hmm, if we look closely, that score of 95 is much bigger than everything else in the 70s—it's definitely an unusual result for this group!
- C. Scores show two equal clusters around 72 and 95 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since we only have one score at 95, it's more like an outlier than a whole separate "cluster" of numbers.
- D. Scores cannot be summarized because there are only five values [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Even with just a few data points, we can still see patterns and describe their general layout.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. All scores are clustered near 73 with one high outlier-like value 95

**Explanation:** Four values cluster in low 70s, while 95 is strikingly larger.

#### Q4 - q_mst_6sp5_004

**Prompt:** Which summary is most complete for a numerical data set?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Only the mean [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The mean is important, but it doesn't give the whole story, like how many points there are or how spread out they might be!
- B. Count, what was measured with units, center, variability, and notable patterns/deviations [CORRECT]
- C. Only a graph title and axis labels [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Labels are super helpful, but a complete summary also needs to explain what the actual numbers are telling us about the data!
- D. Only minimum and maximum [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Knowing the top and bottom scores is a good start, but we also want to understand what's happening in the middle.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Count, what was measured with units, center, variability, and notable patterns/deviations

**Explanation:** A full summary includes sample size, attribute and units, center, variation, and distribution features.

#### Q5 - q_mst_6sp5_005

**Prompt:** Two classes have the same mean quiz score. Class A has much larger IQR than Class B. What conclusion is valid?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Class A scores are more spread out [CORRECT]
- B. Class A has higher center [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The question tells us that both classes have exactly the same mean, so their centers are already identical.
- C. Class B must have more students [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. The IQR is all about the spread of the scores, it doesn't really tell us how many students were in the class!
- D. The two classes have identical distributions [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with your comparisons! Since Class A has a wider spread, their distributions are different even if their averages happen to match.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Class A scores are more spread out

**Explanation:** Larger IQR indicates greater spread in the middle half of the data.

## Module 4: Integers (Negative Numbers) - Integer Operations (Advanced)

- Topic ID: 4.2
- Power standards: 7.NS.1

### Standard 7.NS.1 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.

#### Q1 - q_cc_7ns1_add_int_001

**Prompt:** Compute −4 + 7.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 4 and 7 were added as if they were both negative. Since 7 is positive and has a larger absolute value, our answer should be positive!
- B. 3 [CORRECT]
- C. −3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the subtraction was done right, but the sign was flipped. We want to keep the sign of the larger number (7).
- D. 11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the negative sign on the 4 was missed. Think of it as starting at -4 and then moving 7 steps to the right!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3

**Explanation:** When adding a negative and a positive, subtract the absolute values (7 − 4 = 3) and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value (positive).

#### Q2 - q_cc_7ns1_sub_dblneg_001

**Prompt:** Compute −5 − (−2).

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like -5 minus 2 was calculated. Remember, "minus-minus" actually turns into a "plus," so we're adding 2 instead of subtracting it!
- B. −3 [CORRECT]
- C. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems both signs were switched to positive. Let's keep the -5 and just turn the subtraction of -2 into adding 2.
- D. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the signs! It looks like the order of the numbers might have been swapped. Let's start at -5 and go from there.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. −3

**Explanation:** Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive: −5 − (−2) = −5 + 2 = −3.

#### Q3 - q_cc_7ns1_sub_pos_001

**Prompt:** Compute −3 − 7.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −10 [CORRECT]
- B. −4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 7 minus 3 was calculated. If we start down at -3 and subtract 7, we're moving even further away from zero into the negatives!
- C. 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Imagine a number line: starting at -3 and moving 7 steps to the left will land us at a very negative number.
- D. 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! While 3 and 7 make 10, since we're starting negative and moving more to the left, our final answer must be a negative 10!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −10

**Explanation:** Subtracting a positive moves left on the number line. From −3, moving 7 left lands at −10.

#### Q4 - q_cc_7ns1_add_dec_001

**Prompt:** Compute −3.2 + 1.5. Give the answer as a decimal.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. −1.7 [CORRECT]
- B. 1.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You found the right difference, but since -3.2 is "stronger" (larger absolute value), our final answer keeps that negative sign!
- C. −4.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like you added the numbers up, but because their signs are different, we want to find the gap between them instead.
- D. 4.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with those signs! Since one number is negative and one is positive, we definitely need to use subtraction here.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. −1.7

**Explanation:** With opposite signs, subtract absolute values: 3.2 − 1.5 = 1.7. Since −3.2 has the larger absolute value, the result is −1.7.

#### Q5 - q_cc_7ns1_numline_001

**Prompt:** A student wants to compute −1 − (−4) using a number line. Which reasoning is correct?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Start at −1. Subtracting −4 means move 4 units left to −5. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Moving left is for subtracting positive numbers. When we subtract a negative, we actually head over to the right!
- B. Start at −1. Subtracting −4 is the same as adding 4, so move 4 units right to 3. [CORRECT]
- C. Start at −4 and move to −1, so the answer is −3. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. In this problem, we'll start at the first number (-1) and then use the second number to decide where to move.
- D. Negatives always make it smaller, so the answer must be less than −1. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That's a tricky myth. Subtracting a negative number actually makes our total larger!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Start at −1. Subtracting −4 is the same as adding 4, so move 4 units right to 3.

**Explanation:** On a number line, subtracting a negative means moving right. So −1 − (−4) = −1 + 4 = 3.

## Module 4: Integers (Negative Numbers) - Rational Number Operations

- Topic ID: 4.3
- Power standards: 7.NS.2, 7.NS.3

### Standard 7.NS.2 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ns2_mul_int_001

**Prompt:** Compute: (-4) x 3

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -12 [CORRECT]
- B. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You multiplied 4 and 3 perfectly, but remember our rule: when multiplying a negative and a positive, the result is always negative!
- C. -1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like 4 and 3 might have been subtracted. Let's try 4 times 3 again!
- D. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems 4 and 3 were added up. Since we're multiplying, we want to find the total product.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -12

**Explanation:** Multiply absolute values: 4 x 3 = 12. A negative times a positive is negative, so the result is -12.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ns2_mul_frac_001

**Prompt:** Compute and simplify: (-2/3) x (-9/4)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -3/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You simplified the fractions very well, but remember that a negative times a negative will always result in a positive answer!
- B. 3/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 18/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're almost there! 18/12 is the right math, but simplified it down to its smallest form will make it a perfect final answer.
- D. 2/27 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like division was used by mistake. In multiplication, we multiply straight across: top x top and bottom x bottom.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3/2

**Explanation:** Multiply numerators and denominators: (-2 x -9)/(3 x 4) = 18/12 = 3/2.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ns2_div_int_001

**Prompt:** Compute: 15 ÷ (-3)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -5 [CORRECT]
- B. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You found that 15 divided by 3 is 5, but because the signs are different, the final result must be negative.
- C. -45 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems multiplication was used. For 15 divided by -3, we want to see how many times -3 fits into 15!
- D. -12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like 3 was subtracted from 15. In division, we're trying to share 15 into 3 equal (but negative) groups.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -5

**Explanation:** 15 divided by 3 is 5. Since the signs are different, the quotient is negative: -5.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ns2_div_dec_001

**Prompt:** Compute: (-1.8) ÷ 0.6

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -3 [CORRECT]
- B. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 1.8 divided by 0.6 is indeed 3, but since the first number is negative, our final answer should be -3.
- C. -1.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like subtraction was used. For dividing, we're finding how many 0.6 size "scoops" fit into 1.8!
- D. -0.3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the decimals! When we divide 1.8 by a small part like 0.6, the result actually turns out larger than 1!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -3

**Explanation:** 1.8 ÷ 0.6 = 3. One number is negative and the other is positive, so the quotient is -3.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ns2_sign_rule_001

**Prompt:** Which statement is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. A negative divided by a negative is always negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Remember our "matching twins" rule: if both signs are negative, they combine to make a positive result!
- B. A negative multiplied by a positive is always positive. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If the signs are different, the result will always be negative.
- C. A positive divided by a negative is always negative. [CORRECT]
- D. A positive multiplied by a positive is always negative. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Two positives will always stay positive. A negative can only appear if at least one of the numbers is negative.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. A positive divided by a negative is always negative.

**Explanation:** For multiplication and division, same signs give positive, different signs give negative. So positive divided by negative is negative.

### Standard 7.NS.3 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7ns3_temp_change_001

**Prompt:** The temperature is -3 deg C in the morning and rises by 8 deg C by noon. What is the noon temperature?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 deg C [CORRECT]
- B. -11 deg C [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the temperature moved down. Since it "rose" by 8, we should add that 8 to our starting -3.
- C. -5 deg C [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since 8 is larger than 3, the temperature moves all the way past zero and into the positive territory!
- D. 11 deg C [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with those negatives! It seems both numbers were added as positives. Remember we started down at -3 before it got warmer.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 5 deg C

**Explanation:** Start at -3 and add 8: -3 + 8 = 5, so the noon temperature is 5 deg C.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7ns3_credit_balance_001

**Prompt:** Aiden owes $21. He pays $15, spends $35, then pays $50. What is his final balance?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -$9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you found the final amount, but Aiden actually has a positive balance now since he paid back so much!
- B. $9 credit [CORRECT]
- C. $29 credit [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Let's try combining all the payments and debts one more time—adding what he pays and subtracting what he spends.
- D. $1 credit [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It seems there might have been a small error during the math. Let's double-check the total balance again!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. $9 credit

**Explanation:** Use signed numbers: -21 + 15 - 35 + 50 = 9. A positive result means a $9 credit.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7ns3_fraction_batches_001

**Prompt:** A recipe uses 3/4 cup sugar per batch. How much sugar is needed for 2 1/2 batches?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 7/8 cups [CORRECT]
- B. 2 1/4 cups [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It seems only the 2 was multiplied by the 3/4. We need to multiply the 3/4 by the entire 2 1/2 batches!
- C. 3 1/4 cups [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the numbers were added together instead of multiplied. For multiple batches, multiplication is the way to go!
- D. 1 1/2 cups [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! It looks like only 2 batches were calculated. Don't forget that extra half batch!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1 7/8 cups

**Explanation:** Multiply 3/4 x 2 1/2 = 3/4 x 5/2 = 15/8 = 1 7/8.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7ns3_stock_loss_001

**Prompt:** A stock loses $2.50 each day for 4 days. What is the total change in value?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -$10.00 [CORRECT]
- B. $10.00 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You found the total amount, but since it's a "loss," we should use a negative sign to show the value went down!
- C. -$6.50 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like the numbers were added. Since the loss happens *every* day, we should multiply the daily loss by the number of days.
- D. -$2.50 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That's only the loss for one single day. We need to find the total loss for all four days combined.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -$10.00

**Explanation:** Change = 4 x (-2.50) = -10.00.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7ns3_multi_step_int_001

**Prompt:** A submarine is at -120 meters. It ascends 40 meters, then descends 60 meters. Where is it now?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. -140 meters [CORRECT]
- B. -100 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the descent was skipped. After going up 40, don't forget to go back down by 60!
- C. -220 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems both moves were counted as going down. Remember that ascending means our number gets larger (closer to zero)!
- D. -20 meters [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the starting point! We began at -120, so our final location will still be deep underwater.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. -140 meters

**Explanation:** Start at -120, ascend means +40, descend means -60. So -120 + 40 - 60 = -80 - 60 = -140.
