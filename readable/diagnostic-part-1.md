### Standard 5.NBT.5 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nbt5_mult4x1_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 3,748 × 7?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 25,936 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The multiplication was done correctly, but it looks like a carry digit might have been missed. When using the standard algorithm, it helps to add each carry to the product of the next digit.
- B. 26,236 [CORRECT]
- C. 26,136 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like a different number was carried in one of the steps. In the tens place, 4 times 7 is 28, and adding the carry from before makes 33, which leaves a new carry of 3.
- D. 8,236 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the 748 part was multiplied by 7, but the 3,000 part was not. In this problem, every digit in 3,748 needs to be multiplied by 7 to get the total.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 26,236

**Explanation:** Multiply right to left: 8×7=56 (write 6, carry 5), 4×7+5=33 (write 3, carry 3), 7×7+3=52 (write 2, carry 5), 3×7+5=26. The product is 26,236.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nbt5_secondrow_shift_001

**Prompt:** You are using the standard algorithm to multiply 36 × 25. The first partial product (36 × 5) is 180. What should the second row (for the 2 in 25) be?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 720 [CORRECT]
- B. 72 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the 2 in 25 was treated as 2 ones instead of 2 tens. Because that 2 represents 20, the second row needs to be shifted over to the tens place.
- C. 360 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's good that a zero was added for the tens row, but it looks like the 36 wasn't multiplied by 2. Multiplying 36 by 2 first and then placing it in the tens row will give the right result.
- D. 7,200 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The second row was shifted two places, as if the 2 meant 200. Since the 2 in 25 represents 20, we only need to shift it one place to the left.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 720

**Explanation:** The 2 in 25 means 20. Compute 36×2=72, then shift one place left (×10) to get 720.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nbt5_forgot_shift_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 27 × 14?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 135 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Both parts of the multiplication were found, but it looks like they were added together without moving the tens row. Since the 1 in 14 stands for 10, that row needs to be shifted one place over.
- B. 2,808 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The tens row was moved two places, which would be right if the 1 meant 100. Because it's actually 10, shifting it just one place will help.
- C. 378 [CORRECT]
- D. 358 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's worth re-checking the carries used when multiplying 27 by 4. Making sure to add the carry from 7 times 4 to the next step will lead to the correct answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 378

**Explanation:** Compute 27×4=108 and 27×10=270, then add 108+270=378. That’s the standard algorithm result.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nbt5_carry_placevalue_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 2,316 × 4?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9,264 [CORRECT]
- B. 9,244 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the carry from 6 times 4 was missed in the tens step. Adding that carry to the result of 1 times 4 will give the right number.
- C. 9,444 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The carry seems to have been added to the hundreds place instead of the tens place. It's helpful to remember that carries always move to the very next spot on the left.
- D. 92,640 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the multiplication was done by 40 instead of 4. Double-checking that we're multiplying by ones instead of tens will help here.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 9,264

**Explanation:** 6×4=24 (write 4, carry 2), 1×4+2=6, 3×4=12 (write 2, carry 1), 2×4+1=9. The product is 9,264.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nbt5_zeros_alignment_001

**Prompt:** Use the standard algorithm to multiply. What is 2,030 × 40?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8,120 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The multiplication by 4 was done well, but since the problem is multiplying by 40, the result should be ten times larger. Shifting the answer one place to the left will complete the fact.
- B. 81,200 [CORRECT]
- C. 9,200 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the zero in the middle of 2,030 was left out. Even though it's a zero, it still holds an important place in the number.
- D. 812,000 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: An extra zero was added, as if multiplying by 400. Since 40 has only one zero, we only need to shift the original product one place.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 81,200

**Explanation:** First do 2,030×4=8,120. Because 40=4×10, shift one place left (add one zero): 81,200.

## Module 1: Whole Number Foundations - Multi-Digit Division & Quotients

- Topic ID: 1.4
- Power standards: 5.NBT.6
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NBT.6 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Find whole-number quotients of whole numbers with up to four-digit dividends and two-digit divisors, using strategies based on place value, the properties of operations, and/or the relationship between multiplication and division. Illustrate and explain the calculation by using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nbt6_001

**Prompt:** Compute: 1536 / 24

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 54 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Dividing large numbers can be tricky. It looks like a different multiplication fact for 24 was used here. Checking the multiplication steps one more time might help.
- B. 64 [CORRECT]
- C. 74 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the estimate for how many times 24 fits into the number was a little too high.
- D. 640 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The place value seems to be off by ten. Checking where the first digit of the answer goes can help keep everything lined up.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 64

**Explanation:** 24 x 64 = 1536, so 1536 / 24 = 64.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nbt6_002

**Prompt:** Compute: 2688 / 32

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 84 [CORRECT]
- B. 74 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It looks like the division was stopped just one group too early.
- C. 96 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the estimate for how many groups of 32 could fit was a bit higher than the actual amount.
- D. 8.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Whole numbers were being divided, but the answer was given with a decimal. Keeping the answer as a whole number will match the problem better.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 84

**Explanation:** 32 x 84 = 2688, so the quotient is 84.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nbt6_003

**Prompt:** Compute: 2475 / 25

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 95 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close. It seems the answer is just one group of 25 away from the correct total.
- B. 96 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like 25 times 96 was used, but that doesn't quite reach the full number we're dividing.
- C. 99 [CORRECT]
- D. 100 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Rounding to a nearby number like 100 is a great way to estimate, but this problem asks for an exact division.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 99

**Explanation:** 25 x 99 = 2475, so 2475 / 25 = 99.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nbt6_004

**Prompt:** A warehouse packs 36 pencils in each box. If there are 2016 pencils, how many boxes are filled completely?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 46 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Using subtraction to divide is a good strategy. It looks like the process was started well but stopped a little before reaching the end.
- B. 54 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's possible that a nearby number like 40 was used to divide instead of 36. Using the exact number 36 will give the right result.
- C. 56 [CORRECT]
- D. 66 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the estimate for how many boxes could be filled was a little too high.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 56

**Explanation:** This is 2016 / 36. Since 36 x 56 = 2016, there are 56 boxes.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nbt6_005

**Prompt:** Which equation can be used to check that 1824 / 48 = 38?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 48 + 38 = 1824 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Addition was used here, but to check a division problem, we usually use its opposite operation, which is multiplication.
- B. 1824 - 48 = 38 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Subtraction is related to division, but using multiplication is a simpler way to see if the division was correct.
- C. 48 x 38 = 1824 [CORRECT]
- D. 38 x 38 = 1824 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: In this case, the answer was multiplied by itself. Using the starting number (the divisor) to multiply the answer will correctly check the math.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 48 x 38 = 1824

**Explanation:** To check division, multiply quotient by divisor. 48 x 38 = 1824 confirms the quotient.

## Module 2: The World of Fractions - Visualization & Equivalence

- Topic ID: 2.1
- Power standards: 5.NF.3
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NF.3 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Interpret a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator (*a/b* = *a* ÷ *b*). Solve word problems involving division of whole numbers leading to answers in the form of fractions or mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nf3_001

**Prompt:** Which expression is equal to 7/4?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 7 + 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the fraction bar was read as an addition sign. In math, that bar actually tells us to divide the top number by the bottom number.
- B. 7 - 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the fraction bar was treated like subtraction. That bar is actually a symbol for division.
- C. 7 / 4 [CORRECT]
- D. 4 / 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The numbers are correct, but they're in the wrong spots. When turning a fraction into a division problem, the top number always goes first.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 7 / 4

**Explanation:** A fraction a/b means a divided by b, so 7/4 = 7 / 4.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nf3_002

**Prompt:** Three sandwiches are shared equally by 4 children. How much sandwich does each child get?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4/3 sandwich [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to mix up the order. Here we're dividing the 3 sandwiches by the 4 children, so the 3 should be on top.
- B. 3/4 sandwich [CORRECT]
- C. 1 1/3 sandwiches [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the division was done with 4 sandwiches for 3 children. Since there are fewer sandwiches than children, each child will get less than one whole.
- D. 1/4 sandwich [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like only one sandwich was shared instead of all three. Sharing all the sandwiches together gives a larger piece to each person.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3/4 sandwich

**Explanation:** Equal share means 3 / 4, so each child gets 3/4 sandwich.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nf3_003

**Prompt:** Five liters of juice are poured equally into 2 pitchers. How much is in each pitcher?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 1/2 L [CORRECT]
- B. 2/5 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers in the fraction were swapped. We're dividing the 5 liters by the 2 pitchers, so the 5 should be the numerator.
- C. 3 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Rounding to the nearest whole number is a good guess, but we can find the exact amount by dividing the last liter in half.
- D. 2 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It looks like the 5th liter was left out of the division. If we split that last liter between the two pitchers, each one gets a bit more.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2 1/2 L

**Explanation:** 5 / 2 = 2 1/2, so each pitcher gets 2 1/2 liters.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nf3_004

**Prompt:** Which mixed number is equal to 11/3?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 1/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. When dividing 11 by 3, there's a remainder left over. Re-checking that remainder will help find the exact fraction.
- B. 3 2/3 [CORRECT]
- C. 2 3/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Converting improper fractions can be complex. Since 11 is almost 12, the whole number part should be a bit higher.
- D. 4 1/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the estimate for how many times 3 fits into 11 was a little too high.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3 2/3

**Explanation:** 11 / 3 = 3 remainder 2, so 11/3 = 3 2/3.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nf3_005

**Prompt:** Eight brownies are shared equally among 3 students. Which is the best interpretation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Each student gets 2 brownies. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's a good start. After giving each student 2 brownies, there are still some left over that can be split into smaller pieces so everyone gets a fair share.
- B. Each student gets 2 2/3 brownies. [CORRECT]
- C. Each student gets 3/8 brownie. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were put in the wrong order for the fraction. When we share 8 things among 3 people, each person gets more than one.
- D. Each student gets 3 brownies. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That's a good estimate, but if everyone took 3 brownies, we would need 9 total. Since we only have 8, each person will get a slightly smaller amount.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Each student gets 2 2/3 brownies.

**Explanation:** Equal share is 8 / 3 = 2 2/3 brownies per student.

## Module 2: The World of Fractions - Addition & Subtraction

- Topic ID: 2.2
- Power standards: 5.NF.1, 5.NF.2
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NF.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with like denominators.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nf1_001

**Prompt:** Find 2/5 + 1/3 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the top numbers and bottom numbers were added directly. Because the pieces are different sizes (fifths and thirds), we first need to make them the same size before we can add them together.
- B. 11/15 [CORRECT]
- C. 3/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the numerators were added but only one denominator was kept. We can only add the top numbers once both fractions have the same bottom number.
- D. 7/15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close. It looks like a common denominator was found, but the top number of one fraction wasn't changed to match. When we change the bottom number, we have to change the top number too.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 11/15

**Explanation:** Use a common denominator of 15. Rename: 2/5 = 6/15 and 1/3 = 5/15, then add: 6/15 + 5/15 = 11/15.

#### Q2 - q_cc_5nf1_002

**Prompt:** Find 5/6 − 1/4 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were subtracted straight across. Since denominators represent the size of the pieces, we can only subtract the numerators after we make the pieces the same size.
- B. 7/12 [CORRECT]
- C. 2/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the numerators were subtracted while keeping the denominator of 6. This only works if both fractions start with the same denominator.
- D. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It looks like 12 was used as a common denominator, but 1/4 wasn't converted correctly. 1/4 is equal to 3/12, which would lead to the right answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7/12

**Explanation:** Use a common denominator of 12. Rename: 5/6 = 10/12 and 1/4 = 3/12, then subtract: 10/12 − 3/12 = 7/12.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nf1_003

**Prompt:** Find 1 2/3 + 2 3/4 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 5/7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numerators and denominators were added together. When the bottom numbers don't match, we need to find a common denominator before we can add the fractions.
- B. 4 5/12 [CORRECT]
- C. 3 11/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close. It seems one of the fractions was renamed without changing its numerator to match. To keep the value the same, we multiply the top and bottom by the same number.
- D. 4 17/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is almost correct. The only thing left is to turn the "improper" fraction part (17/12) into a mixed number. 17/12 is the same as 1 5/12.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4 5/12

**Explanation:** Add whole numbers and rename the fractions to twelfths: 2/3 = 8/12 and 3/4 = 9/12. Then 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12 = 1 5/12, so the total is 4 5/12.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nf1_004

**Prompt:** Find 3 1/6 − 1 5/8 in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 13/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close. It looks like borrowing was used for the fractions, but the whole number part wasn't reduced. When we borrow 1 from the 3, it becomes a 2.
- B. 1 13/24 [CORRECT]
- C. 2 11/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the fractions were subtracted in the wrong order to avoid borrowing. When the first fraction is smaller, we can borrow from the whole number to get more pieces.
- D. 1 1/7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the denominators were added together to find a "common" one. Instead, we can look for a number that both 6 and 8 can multiply into, like 24.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1 13/24

**Explanation:** Since 1/6 is smaller than 5/8, borrow 1: 3 1/6 = 2 7/6. Rename to twenty-fourths: 7/6 = 28/24 and 5/8 = 15/24, so 28/24 − 15/24 = 13/24; and 2 − 1 = 1, giving 1 13/24.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nf1_005

**Prompt:** You want to solve 2/3 + 5/6. What is the correct first step?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Add the denominators to get 9, then rewrite both fractions with denominator 9. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like 3 and 6 were added. A common denominator needs to be a multiple of both numbers, rather than their sum.
- B. Rewrite 2/3 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 (so both fractions have like denominators). [CORRECT]
- C. Add numerators and denominators: (2+5)/(3+6). [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the top and bottom numbers were combined directly. Because the bottom numbers represent the size of the pieces, we have to make the pieces match before we add.
- D. Change 2/3 into 2/6 by changing only the denominator to match 6. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like only the bottom number was changed. To keep the fraction's value the same, we have to multiply the top and bottom by the same number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Rewrite 2/3 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 6 (so both fractions have like denominators).

**Explanation:** The denominators must match before adding. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, rename 2/3 as 4/6 (multiply top and bottom by 2), then you can add the sixths.

### Standard 5.NF.2 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole, including cases of unlike denominators, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem. Use benchmark fractions and number sense of fractions to estimate mentally and assess the reasonableness of answers.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nf2_001

**Prompt:** Mina walked 1/4 mile in the morning and 2/3 mile in the afternoon. How far did she walk in all?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/7 mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the top numbers and bottom numbers were added directly. Since the fractions have different denominators, we first need to find a common denominator to add them correctly.
- B. 11/12 mile [CORRECT]
- C. 5/7 mile [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like a different common denominator was used. Finding a number that both 4 and 3 can go into, like 12, will help find the answer.
- D. 1 5/6 miles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This answer is much larger than the two starting amounts. Since neither fraction is even close to 1 whole, the total should be less than 1 1/2.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 11/12 mile

**Explanation:** Use twelfths: 1/4 = 3/12 and 2/3 = 8/12. Sum is 11/12 mile.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nf2_002

**Prompt:** A ribbon was 7/8 meter long. 1/3 meter was used. How much ribbon is left?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6/5 meter [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the bottom numbers were subtracted, which can lead to fractions that don't match the problem. Using a common denominator for both fractions is a better way to subtract.
- B. 11/24 meter [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It might help to re-check the subtraction of the numerators after finding the common denominator of 24.
- C. 13/24 meter [CORRECT]
- D. 2/5 meter [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the bottom numbers were changed without keeping the fractions equivalent. Multiplying the top and bottom by the same amount helps keep the value the same.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 13/24 meter

**Explanation:** Use twenty-fourths: 7/8 = 21/24 and 1/3 = 8/24. Difference is 13/24 meter.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nf2_003

**Prompt:** Estimate first: 5/6 + 7/10 is closest to which whole number?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Both of these fractions are quite large—they're almost 1 whole each. Adding them together will definitely result in a number much bigger than zero.
- B. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since each fraction is already close to 1, adding them together will bring the total closer to 2 wholes.
- C. 2 [CORRECT]
- D. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This estimate is a bit high. Even if both fractions were exactly 1, the total would only be 2. Since they're both less than 1, the total has to be less than 2.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 2

**Explanation:** Both fractions are near 1, so their sum is near 2 (exactly 23/15 = 1 8/15).

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nf2_004

**Prompt:** A tank was filled to 3/5 of its capacity. Then 1/4 of the full tank was added. How full is the tank now?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4/9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the top and bottom numbers were added directly. First finding a common denominator for the two fractions will allow for a correct addition.
- B. 17/20 [CORRECT]
- C. 7/10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like a different common denominator was used. Both 5 and 4 can multiply into 20, which is a good place to start.
- D. 1 2/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This total is more than one full tank. Since both 3/5 and 1/4 are less than 1, their sum should still fit within a single tank.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 17/20

**Explanation:** Use twentieths: 3/5 = 12/20 and 1/4 = 5/20. Total is 17/20.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nf2_005

**Prompt:** Which result is reasonable for 7/8 - 1/10?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 77/80 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This result is larger than the starting 7/8. When we subtract, the final amount should always be smaller than the number we began with.
- B. 3/4 [CORRECT]
- C. 1/80 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the top and bottom numbers were subtracted straight across. Using a common denominator will give a more accurate picture of how much is left.
- D. 9/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like addition instead of subtraction. Taking away 1/10 from 7/8 will leave a smaller amount, not a larger one.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3/4

**Explanation:** Exact value is 31/40 = 0.775, which is close to 3/4 (0.75).

## Module 2: The World of Fractions - Multiplication & Division

- Topic ID: 2.3
- Power standards: 5.NF.4, 5.NF.7
- Challenge standards: None

### Standard 5.NF.4 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction.

#### Q1 - q_cc_5nf4_whole_times_fraction_improper_001

**Prompt:** Compute 8 × 3/5. Give your answer as an improper fraction in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 8 3/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were added instead of multiplied. Multiplying by 8 means we're looking for the total of 8 equal groups of 3/5.
- B. 24/5 [CORRECT]
- C. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The top number was multiplied correctly, but the bottom number still needs to be there to show that we are counting fifths.
- D. 3/40 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like 3/5 was divided into 8 parts. Multiplying by 8 means the amount should get larger, which happens when we multiply the top number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 24/5

**Explanation:** Write 8 as 8/1. Multiply across: (8×3)/(1×5) = 24/5, which is already in simplest form.

  - Misconception: It seems like 6 was added to 5/4. In this problem, we're looking for 6 groups of 5/4, which requires multiplication.
- B. 7 1/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 15/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close! Converting this improper fraction into a mixed number will give the final answer the problem is looking for.
- D. 5/24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the 6 was multiplied into the denominator. Multiplying a fraction by a whole number usually makes the total larger.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7 1/2

**Explanation:** Multiply: (5×6)/4 = 30/4 = 15/2. Convert 15/2 to a mixed number: 7 1/2.

#### Q3 - q_cc_5nf4_fraction_times_fraction_simplify_001

**Prompt:** Compute 6/9 × 3/4. Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**

  - Misconception: That's a great start. Dividing the top and bottom of 18/36 by the same number will help simplify it into its smallest form.
- B. 1/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to mix up fraction rules. When multiplying, we can multiply straight across—top times top and bottom times bottom.
- D. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like only the top numbers were multiplied. In fraction multiplication, we multiply both parts to get the new fraction.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/2

**Explanation:** Multiply: (6×3)/(9×4) = 18/36. Simplify by dividing by 18: 18/36 = 1/2.

#### Q4 - q_cc_5nf4_wordproblem_of_fraction_001

**Prompt:** A recipe uses 2/3 cup of milk. You make 3/4 of the recipe. How much milk do you use? Give your answer in simplest form.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/2 cup [CORRECT]
- B. 1 5/12 cup [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the two amounts were added. In math problems, the word "of" usually means we should multiply the two numbers to find a part of the total.
- C. 2/9 cup [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like only the bottom numbers were multiplied. To find the result, we need to multiply the top numbers together as well.
- D. 8/9 cup [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems one of the fractions was flipped as if dividing. Since we're looking for a part of the original 2/3 cups, multiplication is the way to go.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1/2 cup

**Explanation:** “3/4 of 2/3” means (3/4)×(2/3) = 6/12. Simplify: 6/12 = 1/2 cup.

#### Q5 - q_cc_5nf4_wrong_rule_diagnose_001

**Prompt:** What is 2/3 × 5/6 in simplest form?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the fractions were added. For multiplication, we can just multiply straight across without needing to find a common denominator first.
- B. 5/9 [CORRECT]
- C. 7/18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the top numbers were added while the bottom numbers were multiplied. Multiplying both parts straight across will give the right result.
- D. 10/18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close! The only thing left is to divide the top and bottom by their largest common factor to simplify the fraction.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 5/9

**Explanation:** Multiply: (2×5)/(3×6) = 10/18. Simplify by dividing by 2: 10/18 = 5/9.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nf7_001

**Prompt:** Compute: (1/2) / 4

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the division was done in the opposite order. Dividing a small fraction into 4 parts will make each piece even smaller.
- B. 1/8 [CORRECT]
- C. 2/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Dividing fractions can be tricky. If we split a half into 4 equal pieces, each of those new pieces will be an eighth of the whole.
- D. 4/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the numbers in the problem were swapped. Keeping them in the original order will help lead to the right answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/8

**Explanation:** Dividing by 4 means splitting 1/2 into 4 equal parts: each part is 1/8.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nf7_002

**Prompt:** Compute: 3 / (1/4)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the whole number was multiplied by the fraction. Dividing by 1/4 is like asking how many fourths are in 3 whole pieces.
- B. 12 [CORRECT]
- C. 7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the whole number and the denominator were added. Since each whole is made of 4 fourths, we can multiply to find the total.
- D. 1/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like the answer was flipped. Since we're finding how many small pieces fit into 3 wholes, the result should be a larger whole number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 12

**Explanation:** How many fourths are in 3 wholes? There are 12 fourths, so 3 / (1/4) = 12.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nf7_003

**Prompt:** Compute: (1/3) / 2

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like 1/3 was multiplied by 2. When we divide a piece into two, each new piece becomes smaller.
- B. 1/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the whole number was added to the denominator. If we split 1/3 in half, we can think of it as sharing a third between two people.
- C. 1/6 [CORRECT]
- D. 2/6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. Reducing the fraction to its simplest form (1/6) will give the final answer.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 1/6

**Explanation:** Half of 1/3 is 1/6, so (1/3) / 2 = 1/6.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nf7_004

**Prompt:** How many 1/5-cup servings are in 2 cups?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2/5 serving [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the two numbers were multiplied. To find out how many servings fit, we can divide the 2 cups by the serving size.
- B. 7 servings [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the numbers were added. Since each cup has exactly 5 fifths, multiplying 2 by 5 will give the total number of servings.
- C. 10 servings [CORRECT]
- D. 1/10 serving [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This result would mean there's less than one serving available. Since 2 cups is much larger than 1/5 cup, we should have many servings.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 10 servings

**Explanation:** 2 / (1/5) asks how many fifths are in 2 wholes: 10.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nf7_005

**Prompt:** A 1/6-meter strip is cut into 3 equal pieces. What is the length of each piece?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/18 m [CORRECT]
- B. 1/2 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the division was done in a way that made the pieces larger. Cutting a small strip into 3 more pieces will make each new piece even smaller.
- C. 3/6 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: The numbers were multiplied, but since the strip is being cut into pieces, the length of each one should decrease.
- D. 1/9 m [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems there was a different division used for the denominator. Thinking of it as 1/6 of a group of 3 might help.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1/18 m

**Explanation:** Divide 1/6 by 3: (1/6) / 3 = 1/18 meter.
