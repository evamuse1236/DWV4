#### Q5 - q_cc_5nbt7_div_dec_dec_001

**Prompt:** Compute 0.63 ÷ 0.09.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.07 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It looks like the decimal in the 0.09 was moved to make it 9, but the 0.63 wasn't changed by the same amount. If we multiply the divisor by 100, we should do the same for the dividend to keep everything balanced.
- B. 7 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. When 0.09 is changed into 9, the decimal point moves two spots to the right. Moving the decimal point in the 0.63 by those same two spots will help lead to the right answer.
- D. 700 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the decimal in 0.63 was moved to make it 63, but the 0.09 stayed the same. In decimal division, it's best to shift both numbers by the same amount to keep the problem the same.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 7

**Explanation:** Make the divisor a whole number by multiplying both numbers by 100: 0.63 ÷ 0.09 = 63 ÷ 9 = 7.

- Topic ID: 3.2
- Power standards: 5.NBT.1, 5.NBT.3
- Challenge standards: 5.NBT.2

### Standard 5.NBT.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place represents 10 times as much as it represents in the place to its right and 1/10 of what it represents in the place to its left.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nbt1_001

**Prompt:** Compute: 0.63 x 10

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.063 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the digits were moved in a direction that made the number smaller. Multiplying by 10 should move each digit to a larger place-value spot.
- B. 6.3 [CORRECT]
- C. 63 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're very close. Multiplying by 10 increases the value by exactly one place-value spot. It seems the digits moved two spots instead of one.
- D. 0.73 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the focus was on changing the digits themselves. For these types of problems, the digits usually stay the same, but the spot where they sit changes.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 6.3

**Explanation:** Multiplying by 10 shifts digits one place left: 0.63 becomes 6.3.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nbt1_002

**Prompt:** Compute: 4.8 x 100

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. It looks like the digits moved one spot. Since there are two zeros in 100, the digits should move two spots to the left.
- B. 480 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.048 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the digits moved in a direction that made the number smaller. Multiplying by 100 should result in a much larger number.
- D. 40.8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the digits were moved individually instead of keeping the whole number together. Shifting everything at once will help get the right value.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 480

**Explanation:** Multiplying by 100 shifts digits two places left: 4.8 becomes 480.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nbt1_003

**Prompt:** Compute: 53.2 ÷ 10

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 532 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like each digit was moved to a larger place-value spot. Division usually makes the number smaller, which happens when digits move to the right.
- B. 0.532 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It seems the digits moved two spots to the right instead of one.
- C. 5.32 [CORRECT]
- D. 53.02 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like a zero was added inside the number. To divide by 10, each digit just needs to shift exactly one spot over.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 5.32

**Explanation:** Dividing by 10 shifts digits one place right: 53.2 becomes 5.32.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nbt1_004

**Prompt:** Compute: 7.05 ÷ 100

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.705 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! Dividing by 100 means the digits move two spots to smaller place-value spots. This looks like a shift of only one spot.
- B. 70.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the digits moved to the left, which would make the number larger. Division by 100 should result in a smaller value.
- C. 7.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Keeping every digit, including the zero, is important when shifting numbers. The position of each digit matters for the final value.
- D. 0.0705 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 0.0705

**Explanation:** Dividing by 100 shifts digits two places right: 7.05 becomes 0.0705.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nbt1_005

**Prompt:** Compute: 0.089 x 1000

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.89 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're on the right track. Multiplying by 1000 means the digits move three spots to the left to larger values. This looked like a shift of just one spot.
- B. 8.9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is close. It looks like a shift of two spots. Since 1000 has three zeros, the shift should be exactly three spots.
- C. 890 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the digits moved four spots instead of three.
- D. 89 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 89

**Explanation:** Multiplying by 1000 shifts digits three places left: 0.089 becomes 89.

### Standard 5.NBT.3 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nbt3_001

**Prompt:** Which decimal is read as 'four and twenty-seven thousandths'?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 4.270 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is a common mix-up. This number is "four and two hundred seventy thousandths." For the "twenty-seven" part, its position needs to start just one spot further to the right.
- B. 4.027 [CORRECT]
- C. 4.27 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This would be "four and twenty-seven hundredths." For thousandths, there should be a zero in the tenths place to push the 27 into the correct spots.
- D. 4.0027 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the digits were pushed one place too far into the ten-thousandths spot.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 4.027

**Explanation:** Twenty-seven thousandths is 0.027, so the number is 4.027.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nbt3_002

**Prompt:** Write 0.506 in words.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. five hundred six tenths [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the wrong place-value name was used. Looking at how many numbers are after the decimal point will help name the place correctly.
- B. five hundred six hundredths [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. Three decimal places usually mean "thousandths," while two places would be "hundredths."
- C. five hundred six thousandths [CORRECT]
- D. fifty-six thousandths [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the zero in the middle was left out. That zero is important for keeping the other numbers in their proper spots.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. five hundred six thousandths

**Explanation:** 0.506 means 506 thousandths.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nbt3_003

**Prompt:** Which comparison is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.47 > 0.507 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's easy to look at the length of the number first. However, starting with the tenths place is the best way to compare—0.5 is larger than 0.4!
- B. 0.507 > 0.57 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It might help to add a zero to 0.57 to make it 0.570. This makes it easier to see that 570 is bigger than 507.
- C. 0.507 > 0.497 [CORRECT]
- D. 0.507 = 0.57 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Although they look similar, those digits are in different spots. Each place value after the decimal point changes the total value.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 0.507 > 0.497

**Explanation:** Compare thousandths: 0.507 has 507 thousandths and 0.497 has 497 thousandths, so 0.507 is greater.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nbt3_004

**Prompt:** Order these decimals from least to greatest: 0.64, 0.604, 0.46, 0.640

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.46, 0.604, 0.64, 0.640 [CORRECT]
- B. 0.604, 0.46, 0.64, 0.640 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like 0.46 was misplaced. Checking the tenths place first will help—4 is smaller than 6, so 0.46 should come before the others.
- C. 0.46, 0.64, 0.640, 0.604 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems 0.604 was treated as larger than 0.64. If we think of them as thousandths, 640 is larger than 604.
- D. 0.604, 0.64, 0.640, 0.46 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like 0.46 was treated as if it were a much smaller decimal. Since the 4 is in the tenths place, it's fairly close to the other numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 0.46, 0.604, 0.64, 0.640

**Explanation:** Write to thousandths: 0.460, 0.604, 0.640, 0.640. So 0.46 is least, then 0.604, then 0.64 and 0.640 (equal).

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nbt3_005

**Prompt:** In 7.305, what value does the digit 3 represent?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 ones [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like its position was mixed up with the number before the decimal. The number to the left of the point represents ones, but anything to the right is less than a whole.
- B. 3 tenths [CORRECT]
- C. 3 hundredths [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. The first spot after the decimal point is the tenths place. Hundredths would be the second spot over.
- D. 3 thousandths [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the place value was moved a bit too far to the right. Let's look at the decimal point and count the spots carefully.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3 tenths

**Explanation:** In 7.305, the first digit to the right of the decimal is tenths, so the 3 means 3 tenths.

### Standard 5.NBT.2 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Explain patterns in the number of zeros of the product when multiplying a number by powers of 10, and explain patterns in the placement of the decimal point when a decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nbt2_001

**Prompt:** What is 47 x 10^3?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 470 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like only one ten was used. The small "3" (exponent) means the number should be multiplied by 10 three different times.
- B. 4700 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like two tens were used. That exponent of 3 tells us to increase the value by three place-value spots.
- C. 47000 [CORRECT]
- D. 470000 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the value was increased by four spots instead of three.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 47000

**Explanation:** 10^3 = 1000, so 47 x 1000 = 47000.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nbt2_002

**Prompt:** Compute: 6.25 x 100

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 62.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're halfway there. Multiplying by 100 means shifting each digit two spots to the left. This looked like a shift of only one spot.
- B. 625 [CORRECT]
- C. 0.0625 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the digits moved the other way. Multiplying by 100 makes the number larger, which happens when digits move to the left.
- D. 6.2500 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Adding zeros to the end of a decimal doesn't change how much it's worth. Shifting those actual digits into larger spots will help.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 625

**Explanation:** Multiplying by 100 moves digits two places left: 6.25 becomes 625.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nbt2_003

**Prompt:** Compute: 0.48 / 10^2

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.048 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is very close. The exponent of 2 means we should divide by 10 twice (or by 100). This looks like a division of just one ten.
- B. 0.0048 [CORRECT]
- C. 48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the digits moved in the wrong direction. Division makes the number smaller, which happens when digits move to the right.
- D. 0.48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the division hasn't happened yet. In math, those powers of ten will always change the value of the number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0.0048

**Explanation:** 10^2 = 100, so 0.48 / 100 = 0.0048.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nbt2_004

**Prompt:** Which expression equals 900000?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9 x 10^4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! That expression gives 90,000. One more power of ten will give us the six-digit number we're looking for.
- B. 9 x 10^5 [CORRECT]
- C. 9 x 10^6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems this one is just a little too large. That expression would result in 9,000,000.
- D. 90 x 10^5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This one is ten times larger than what we need. 90 already has a zero, so adding five more would give us a seven-digit number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 9 x 10^5

**Explanation:** 10^5 = 100000, and 9 x 100000 = 900000.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nbt2_005

**Prompt:** If 3.7 x 10^n = 3700, what is n?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Multiplying by 10 would give 37. We need to go a few more spots to reach 3700!
- B. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! Multiplying by 10^2 gives 370. Just one more spot to the left will get us to 3700.
- C. 3 [CORRECT]
- D. 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This would be 37,000, which moves the decimal point one step past the number we want.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 3

**Explanation:** 3.7 to 3700 is a shift of 3 places left, so n = 3.

## Module 3: Decimals - Decimal Reasoning & Estimation

### Standard 5.NBT.4 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use place value understanding to round decimals to any place.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5nbt4_001

**Prompt:** Round 6.284 to the nearest tenth.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 6.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. When we round to the tenths place, we have to look at its neighbor to decide whether to stay there or go up. Since 8 is big, we move up to 6.3.
- B. 6.3 [CORRECT]
- C. 6.28 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This rounds the number to two decimal places. For tenths, we just need one number after the point.
- D. 7.0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the number was rounded to a whole number. Let's look closely at the tenths place instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 6.3

**Explanation:** The tenths digit is 2. The hundredths digit is 8, so round up to 6.3.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5nbt4_002

**Prompt:** Round 9.746 to the nearest hundredth.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9.74 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! Since the next digit (6) is 5 or more, the hundredths place gets rounded up.
- B. 9.75 [CORRECT]
- C. 9.8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This rounds to the tenths place. For the hundredths place, we need two numbers after the decimal point.
- D. 10.00 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the number was rounded quite a bit into the next whole number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 9.75

**Explanation:** Check the thousandths digit (6). Since it is 5 or more, round 9.74 up to 9.75.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5nbt4_003

**Prompt:** Round 12.49 to the nearest whole number.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 12 [CORRECT]
- B. 13 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's very close! Since the tenths digit (4) is less than 5, we keep the whole number as it is and round down to 12.
- C. 12.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This rounds to the tenths place. The problem is asking for a whole number with no decimals.
- D. 12.4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the decimal was kept, but for a whole number, we stop at the ones place.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 12

**Explanation:** The tenths digit is 4, so 12.49 rounds down to 12.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5nbt4_004

**Prompt:** Round 3.650 to the nearest tenth.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3.6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. When we see a 5 in the hundredths place, it usually tells us to round the tenths place up to the next number.
- B. 3.7 [CORRECT]
- C. 3.65 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This is the hundredths place. For the tenths place, we only need one digit after the decimal.
- D. 4.0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the number was rounded all the way to a whole number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3.7

**Explanation:** To round to tenths, check hundredths. The hundredths digit is 5, so 3.6 rounds up to 3.7.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5nbt4_005

**Prompt:** A bottle has 1.983 liters of juice. About how much is that to the nearest hundredth?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1.98 L [CORRECT]
- B. 1.99 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close! Since the next digit (3) is less than 5, we keep the hundredths place as an 8 and round down.
- C. 2.00 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This rounds the number to a whole number. Let's look for a bit more detail!
- D. 1.9 L [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This rounds to one decimal place, but the problem asked for the hundredths place (two places).

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1.98 L

**Explanation:** For hundredths, look at thousandths. Since 3 is less than 5, 1.983 rounds to 1.98.

## Module 6: Algebra - Expressions & Exponents

- Topic ID: 6.1
- Power standards: 5.OA.1, 5.OA.2

### Standard 5.OA.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

  - Misconception: It looks like addition was done before multiplication. In standard math order, we usually start with multiplication before we add the parts together.
- C. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're close. It looks like the multiplication was finished, but the final step is to add that onto the 8.
- D. 44 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems some of the steps might have been used in a different order.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 20

**Explanation:** Multiply first: 4 x 3 = 12. Then add 8 to get 20.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5oa1_002

**Prompt:** Evaluate: (8 + 4) x 3

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were multiplied before being added together. When there are parentheses, it's a signal to do that part first!
- B. 36 [CORRECT]
- C. 24 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're halfway there. Adding the numbers inside the parentheses was a great start. The last step is to multiply that result by 3.
- D. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems some of the numbers might have been combined in a non-standard order.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 36

**Explanation:** Parentheses first: 8 + 4 = 12. Then 12 x 3 = 36.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5oa1_003

**Prompt:** Evaluate: 24 ÷ (2 x 3)

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 36 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like multiplication was used throughout. In this problem, we first find the product of 2 and 3, and then we divide 24 by that brand-new number.
- B. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like 24 was divided by 2. After doing that, we still need to take that answer and divide it by the other part of the parentheses.
- C. 4 [CORRECT]
- D. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like some of the numbers in the problem were mixed up during the calculation.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 4

**Explanation:** Compute parentheses first: 2 x 3 = 6. Then 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5oa1_004

**Prompt:** Which expression matches: 'Add 7 to the product of 5 and 6'?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (7 + 5) x 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the addition was done first. To find the "product of 5 and 6" first, we need those numbers to be grouped together for multiplication.
- B. 7 x (5 + 6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This would mean multiplying 7 by a total. The problem asks us to start with the multiplication of 5 and 6, and then add 7.
- C. 5 x (6 + 7) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the operations were switched. This choice adds before multiplying, but we want to add at the very end.
- D. 7 + (5 x 6) [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 7 + (5 x 6)

**Explanation:** The product of 5 and 6 is grouped first, then 7 is added: 7 + (5 x 6).

#### Q5 - q_mst_5oa1_005

**Prompt:** Evaluate: 48 ÷ 6 + 3 x 2

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 19 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like addition happened right in the middle. In math, we usually finish all division and multiplication first before we add any quantities together.
- B. 14 [CORRECT]
- C. 22 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems some of the operations might have been done in a different order than standard math.
- D. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like the first division was done, but the rest of the problem is still waiting to be finished!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 14

**Explanation:** Do division and multiplication first: 48 ÷ 6 = 8 and 3 x 2 = 6. Then 8 + 6 = 14.

### Standard 5.OA.2 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Write simple expressions that record calculations with numbers, and interpret numerical expressions without evaluating them.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5oa2_001

**Prompt:** Evaluate 3n + 4 when n = 5.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 19 [CORRECT]
- B. 35 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the 3 and 5 were put together into the single number 35. When a number is next to a letter like "n," it's a sign to multiply them!
- C. 17 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like 4 was subtracted. Re-checking that plus sign will help lead to the right result.
- D. 12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've got the first part down! Multiplying 3 by 5 gave you 15. The last step is to add that final 4.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 19

**Explanation:** Substitute n = 5: 3(5) + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5oa2_002

**Prompt:** Evaluate 18 ÷ m when m = 3.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 54 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like multiplication was used. Let's try dividing the 18 into 3 equal groups instead.
- B. 6 [CORRECT]
- C. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like subtraction was used. In this problem, the division symbol tells us how to combine 18 and m.
- D. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Re-checking the division fact for 18 and 3 might help find the exact number.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 6

**Explanation:** Replace m with 3: 18 ÷ 3 = 6.

#### Q3 - q_mst_5oa2_003

**Prompt:** Which expression means '5 less than twice p'?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 5 - 2p [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This says "2p less than 5." When we want "5 less than" something, we start with that something and then take away 5 at the end.
- B. 2(p - 5) [WRONG]
- C. 2p - 5 [CORRECT]
- D. p - 10 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the 5 was doubled instead of the p. "Twice p" means p gets multiplied by 2.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 2p - 5

**Explanation:** Twice p is 2p. Five less than that is 2p - 5.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5oa2_004

**Prompt:** Evaluate (x + 8) ÷ 4 when x = 12.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like x was divided by 4 first. When there are parentheses around x + 8, it means we should add those together before doing the division.
- B. 11 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Adding 12 and 8 was a great start. Now, we take that total and divide it by 4 to get the final answer.
- C. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems like the operations were done in a different order. Following the parentheses first will help.
- D. 5 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 5

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 12: (12 + 8) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5oa2_005

**Prompt:** Evaluate 4a - 2b when a = 3 and b = 5.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 2 [CORRECT]
- B. 34 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the numbers were just placed together in the expression. Putting a number next to a letter means we should multiply them.
- C. -2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the subtraction was done in reverse. After multiplying both parts, we subtract the second answer from the first one.
- D. 22 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like there was a small slip during the multiplication step. Multiplying 4 times 3 and 2 times 5 separately first will clear things up.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 2

**Explanation:** Compute each term: 4a = 12 and 2b = 10. Then 12 - 10 = 2.

## Module 6: Algebra - Patterns & Relations

- Topic ID: 6.3
- Power standards: None
- Challenge standards: 5.OA.3

### Standard 5.OA.3 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Generate two numerical patterns using two given rules. Identify apparent relationships between corresponding terms. Form ordered pairs consisting of corresponding terms from the two patterns, and graph the ordered pairs on a coordinate plane.

#### Q1 - q_mst_5oa3_001

**Prompt:** Pattern A starts at 0 and adds 3 each step. Pattern B starts at 0 and adds 6 each step. Which relationship is true for corresponding terms?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. A is always twice B [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the patterns were switched. Since B grows by 6 while A grows by 3, Pattern B will be the larger one.
- B. B is always twice A [CORRECT]
- C. A and B are always equal [WRONG]
  - Misconception: They start at the same place, but because B takes bigger steps each time, it will pull ahead of A as they grow.
- D. B is always A + 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's natural to look for a constant difference. If we list out the numbers (3, 6, 9... and 6, 12, 18...), we can see they're growing as multiples.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. B is always twice A

**Explanation:** Each B step is 6 while each A step is 3, so B is always 2 times A.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5oa3_002

**Prompt:** Pattern A: start 2, add 4. Pattern B: start 2, add 8. What is the 4th ordered pair (A, B), counting the start as term 1?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (10, 18) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You're on the right track! It looks like you found the 3rd term in the pattern. Taking just one more step will get you to the 4th term.
- B. (14, 26) [CORRECT]
- C. (12, 24) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems some of the steps got a bit mixed up. Listing them out one by one starting from 2 will help keep them straight.
- D. (16, 30) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Close! It looks like there might have been an extra step added on at the end.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (14, 26)

**Explanation:** Term 1 is (2,2). Term 2 is (6,10). Term 3 is (10,18). Term 4 is (14,26).

#### Q3 - q_mst_5oa3_003

**Prompt:** Pattern A: start 1, multiply by 2 each step. Pattern B: start 4, multiply by 2 each step. Which is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. B is always A + 3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That works for the very first step, but because we're multiplying, the difference between the numbers will grow as we go.
- B. B is always 4 times A [CORRECT]
- C. A is always 4 times B [WRONG]
  - Misconception: You've found the right relationship, but the order is reversed. Since B starts at 4 and A starts at 1, B is the larger number.
- D. A and B become equal after enough steps [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since both patterns grow by the same multiplicative factor, Pattern B will stay ahead of Pattern A forever.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. B is always 4 times A

**Explanation:** Both patterns double each step, so their ratio stays constant. Since 4 is 4 x 1, B is always 4 times A.

#### Q4 - q_mst_5oa3_004

**Prompt:** The ordered pairs from two patterns are: (3, 5), (6, 10), (9, 15), (12, 20). What rule links y to x?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. y = x + 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: That works for the first pair, but doesn't quite fit the others. A multiplicative rule might work for all of them!
- B. y = 2x [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Doubling would reach 6, 12, and 18. The y-values are just a little bit smaller than that.
- C. y = (5/3)x [CORRECT]
- D. y = x - 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the subtraction might have been done with a different set of numbers.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. y = (5/3)x

**Explanation:** Each y/x ratio is 5/3, so y = (5/3)x.

#### Q5 - q_mst_5oa3_005

**Prompt:** Pattern A: start 4, add 2. Pattern B: start 9, add 3. For the first five terms, what is true about B - A?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. It stays 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It starts at 5, but because Pattern B adds 3 while Pattern A only adds 2, Pattern B will pull ahead by one more each time.
- B. It decreases by 1 each term [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the step sizes were mixed up. Since Pattern B is growing faster, the distance between them will actually grow too.
- C. It increases by 1 each term [CORRECT]
- D. It alternates between 5 and 6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Since both rules stay consistent, the difference between the two patterns will also change in a consistent way.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. It increases by 1 each term

**Explanation:** Initial difference is 9 - 4 = 5. Since B adds 3 and A adds 2 each term, the difference increases by 1 each term.

## Module 7: Geometry, Data & Probability - Coordinate Geometry

- Topic ID: 7.1
- Power standards: 5.G.1
- Challenge standards: 5.G.2

### Standard 5.G.1 (Grade 5) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered pair of numbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the first number indicates how far to travel from the origin in the direction of one axis, and the second number indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second axis, with the convention that the names of the two axes and the coordinates correspond (e.g., x-axis and x-coordinate, y-axis and y-coordinate).

#### Q1 - q_mst_5g1_001

**Prompt:** Point A is at (3, 5). Which number tells how far to move along the x-axis?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3 [CORRECT]
- B. 5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: This looks like the y-coordinate. In math, we всегда follow the order of (x, y), so the first number tells us how far across the system to move.
- C. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the two numbers were added. To find the x-coordinate, we only need to look at the first number in the pair.
- D. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It seems the point was thought to be on vertical line. The value of 3 shows it's actually three units to the right of that line.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3

**Explanation:** In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number is the x-coordinate, so x = 3.

#### Q2 - q_mst_5g1_002

**Prompt:** Start at the origin. Move 4 units right and 2 units up. What point do you reach?

**Visual:** Inline visual HTML present

**Choices:**
- A. (2, 4) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It's very easy to swap the order of x and y. If we remember "across then up," the 4 (horizontal) should come first.
- B. (4, 2) [CORRECT]
- C. (-4, 2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Moving "right" means positive numbers on the x-axis. Using a negative sign would mean moving left instead.
- D. (4, -2) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Moving "up" means positive numbers on the y-axis. A negative sign would mean moving down.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (4, 2)

**Explanation:** Right is positive x and up is positive y, so the point is (4, 2).

#### Q3 - q_mst_5g1_003

**Prompt:** Which point has x-coordinate 6 and y-coordinate 1?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. (1, 6) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the x and y coordinates were swapped. The horizontal x-distance always comes first in the pair!
- B. (6, 1) [CORRECT]
- C. (6, -1) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Almost! Re-checking the sign of the y-coordinate will help—it should be a positive 1.
- D. (7, 1) [WRONG]
  - Misconception: It looks like the x-coordinate was changed slightly. Keeping it as 6 will lead to the right point.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. (6, 1)
