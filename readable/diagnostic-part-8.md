#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp2_multi_samples_001

**Prompt:** Why might a researcher generate multiple random samples of the same size?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. To eliminate all variation so every estimate is identical. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It's actually impossible to get rid of all variation in the real world. Multiple samples help us *understand* those differences, rather than making them go away!
- B. To understand how much estimates can vary due to random sampling. [CORRECT]
- C. Because one random sample can never be used for inference. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. One good random sample is actually very helpful! But having more than one helps us see how much the results might fluctuate from group to group.
- D. To guarantee the true population value is found exactly. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with your expectations! Samples give us amazing "ballpark" estimates, but they rarely give us the 100% exact number for the whole population.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. To understand how much estimates can vary due to random sampling.

**Explanation:** Multiple samples help measure sampling variability and how stable estimates are.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp2_prediction_001

**Prompt:** A random sample finds that 64% of households recycle weekly. Predict approximately how many of 2,500 households recycle weekly.

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1,600 [CORRECT]
- B. 640 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you calculated for 1,000 households instead. Multiplication between 0.64 and the full 2,500 will give us the right total!
- C. 2,040 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems you might have found the number of households that *don't* recycle instead. Let's stick with the recyclable group!
- D. 1,250 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That's exactly 50% of the households. Our survey says the number is a bit higher—closer to 64%!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1,600

**Explanation:** Convert 64% to 0.64 and multiply: 0.64 x 2500 = 1600.

### Standard 7.SP.3 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp3_001

**Prompt:** Two data sets have similar spread. Set A center is 42, set B center is 46, and typical variability measure is 2. The center difference is how many variability units?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like only part of the difference was used. The total gap between the centers is 4, which is exactly *two* units of 2!
- B. 2 [CORRECT]
- C. 4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 4 is the raw difference between the numbers. We want to see how many "units of 2" (our variability measure) that 4 represents.
- D. 8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems like the numbers were multiplied. To find out "how many units," we should divide the gap by the variability measure!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 2

**Explanation:** Center difference is 46 - 42 = 4. Divide by variability 2 to get 2 variability units.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp3_002

**Prompt:** If two dot plots have large visual overlap and similar variability, what is a reasonable conclusion?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The groups are definitely identical [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Even if they look very similar, it doesn't mean every single data point is exactly the same in both groups. There can still be small differences!
- B. Any center difference is likely small relative to spread [CORRECT]
- C. Centers must differ by at least 5 spread units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If the centers were that far apart, the two groups wouldn't overlap much at all—they'd be grouped on opposite ends!
- D. Variability is zero [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! If variability were zero, every single dot would be in one exact stack. Overlap just means the groups are mixed together.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Any center difference is likely small relative to spread

**Explanation:** Large overlap usually means the center difference is small compared to variability.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp3_003

**Prompt:** Set A and B each have MAD about 3. Their medians are 18 and 27. How many MADs apart are the centers?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The total gap between 18 and 27 is 9. Since each MAD is 3 units, we need to see how many times 3 goes into 9!
- B. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the division was slightly off. 9 divided by 3 should give us a whole number result!
- C. 3 [CORRECT]
- D. 9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! 9 is the raw difference between the medians. We want to express that difference in "MAD units" instead.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. 3

**Explanation:** Median difference is 27 - 18 = 9. With MAD 3, that is 9/3 = 3 MADs.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp3_004

**Prompt:** Which situation suggests less overlap between two similarly spread distributions?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Center difference is 0.5 MAD [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! When the centers are that close (only half a MAD away), the two groups will be very bundled together with a lot of overlap!
- B. Center difference is 1 MAD [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. With only 1 MAD of difference, the groups will still be quite mixed in the center.
- C. Center difference is 3 MADs [CORRECT]
- D. Center difference is 0 MAD [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! If the centers have zero difference, the groups are sitting right on top of each other with the *most* possible overlap!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Center difference is 3 MADs

**Explanation:** Larger center separation in spread units generally means less visual overlap.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp3_005

**Prompt:** Two groups have similar variability. Group X center is 64, Group Y center is 58, variability measure is 2 for both. Best interpretation?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Groups differ by 3 variability units, so centers are substantially separated [CORRECT]
- B. Groups differ by 6 variability units [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 6 is the raw difference between the numbers. To find the "variability units," we divide that 6 by the scale factor of 2!
- C. Groups differ by 1 variability unit [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Let's re-calculate: 64 minus 58 is 6. How many units of 2 fit into that 6?
- D. Groups cannot be compared without exact same data values [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We can actually learn a lot just by comparing the centers and the spread, even without seeing every individual number.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Groups differ by 3 variability units, so centers are substantially separated

**Explanation:** Difference is 64 - 58 = 6. Divide by 2 gives 3 variability units.

### Standard 7.SP.4 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp4_001

**Prompt:** Sample A and B are random samples from two schools. Mean test scores are 78 and 85, with similar spread. Best inference?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. School B likely has higher average score than School A [CORRECT]
- B. Schools must have exactly identical populations [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Since the sample scores are quite different (78 vs 85), it's more likely that the schools' overall scores are different too!
- C. No inference is possible from random samples [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Making these kinds of "likely" predictions is exactly what random samples are for!
- D. School A is definitely better with certainty [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! School A's score of 78 is actually lower than 85, so it's reaching a different conclusion than what the data shows.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. School B likely has higher average score than School A

**Explanation:** With random samples and similar variability, a higher sample mean suggests a higher population center.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp4_002

**Prompt:** Two samples have the same mean, but Sample X has much larger variability. What is reasonable?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Centers look similar, but consistency differs [CORRECT]
- B. Populations must have different means [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! The question tells us the means are the same. It's the "spread" (variability) that is really different between the two groups.
- C. Variability has no effect on inference [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Variability is super important because it tells us if the data is predictable or all over the place!
- D. Sample X has no spread [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! "Larger variability" actually means Sample X is *more* spread out than Sample Y is.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Centers look similar, but consistency differs

**Explanation:** Equal centers suggest similar typical value, while different spread suggests different consistency.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp4_003

**Prompt:** Sample medians are 14 and 16, with large overlap and high variability in both groups. Best conclusion?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. There may be only a small population difference, if any [CORRECT]
- B. Population 2 is certainly much larger in center [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Because the groups overlap so much and are so spread out, we can't be "certain" about a large difference based on such a small gap.
- C. Population 1 must be larger because 14 is smaller [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 14 is actually the smaller number here. But even then, the high overlap makes it hard to be sure about anything.
- D. Random samples cannot be used for inference [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We CAN use them to make a cautious guess, but the data here tells us the difference is likely very subtle.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. There may be only a small population difference, if any

**Explanation:** When overlap is large relative to center difference, only cautious inference is reasonable.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp4_004

**Prompt:** Which condition makes a comparative inference stronger?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Centers far apart and variability small [CORRECT]
- B. Centers very close and variability large [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! If the centers are close and the groups are all spread out, it's very hard to tell them apart. That makes our inference weaker!
- C. Non-random convenience samples only [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! Random samples are always the most reliable way for making a strong, credible inference.
- D. Ignoring variability entirely [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We always need to account for variability because it tells us how much we can trust that the center value is truly "typical."

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Centers far apart and variability small

**Explanation:** Large center separation with low spread gives clearer group differences.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp4_005

**Prompt:** Sample A has mean 52 and MAD 2. Sample B has mean 55 and MAD 8. Which inference is best?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. B has a higher center but much greater spread [CORRECT]
- B. A has higher center and greater spread [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like our labels were swapped. B has the higher mean (55) and the larger MAD (8), which means it's more spread out!
- C. The samples must come from identical populations [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since both the centers and the variability are quite different, it's very likely these are two distinct groups.
- D. MAD does not matter for inference [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! The MAD is what tells us that B is much less "consistent" or predictable than A.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. B has a higher center but much greater spread

**Explanation:** B's mean is larger (55 vs 52), but B is less consistent due to higher MAD.

### Standard 7.SP.5 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around 1/2 indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp5_spinner_001

**Prompt:** A spinner has 8 equal sections. 2 are red, 3 are blue, and 3 are green. What is P(red)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/4 [CORRECT]
- B. 2/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like red was compared only to the other colors. Remember: probability is red sections out of the *total* number of slots (2 out of 8)!
- C. 1/8 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We have two red sections, so the top of our fraction should be a 2 instead of a 1.
- D. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Probability must always be between 0 and 1. 2 is the count of red sections, but we need the fraction!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1/4

**Explanation:** Probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes: 2/8 = 1/4.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp5_range_001

**Prompt:** Which value cannot be a probability?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, 0 *is* a valid probability! It just means an event is "impossible," like rolling a 7 on a standard die.
- B. 0.62 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since 0.62 is between 0 and 1, it's a perfectly fine probability.
- C. 1 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! 1 is the highest valid probability possible. It means an event is "100% ciertos" to happen!
- D. 1.4 [CORRECT]

**Correct Answer(s):** D. 1.4

**Explanation:** Probabilities must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. So 1.4 is not possible.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp5_compare_001

**Prompt:** Which event is more likely?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Event A with probability 0.72 [CORRECT]
- B. Event B with probability 3/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 3/5 is the same as 0.60. Since 0.60 is smaller than 0.72, Event B is actually less likely.
- C. They are equally likely [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. When we turn 3/5 into a decimal (0.60), we can see it's quite a bit smaller than 0.72.
- D. Cannot be determined [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! We have all the numbers we need—it's just easiest to compare them when they are both written as decimals!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Event A with probability 0.72

**Explanation:** Convert 3/5 to 0.6. Since 0.72 > 0.6, Event A is more likely.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp5_likelihood_001

**Prompt:** A probability of 0.03 is best described as:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Likely [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! A "likely" event usually has a probability close to 1 (like 0.90). 0.03 is very close to zero!
- B. Neither likely nor unlikely [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. That description is usually for probabilities around 0.50. 0.03 is extremely small.
- C. Unlikely [CORRECT]
- D. Certain [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! A "certain" event always has a probability of exactly 1. 0.03 means it's a very rare occurrence!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Unlikely

**Explanation:** 0.03 is very close to 0, so the event is unlikely.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp5_complement_001

**Prompt:** If P(rain tomorrow) = 0.28, what is P(no rain tomorrow)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.28 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 0.28 is the chance that it *will* rain. We're looking for the opposite: the part that fits into 100% total!
- B. 0.72 [CORRECT]
- C. 1.28 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Probabilities can never go above 1. To find the opposite, we should subtract 0.28 *from* 1.
- D. 0.5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! While we never know for sure, we can use the exact 0.28 chance to calculate the exact opposite chance of 0.72.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 0.72

**Explanation:** An event and its complement add to 1. So P(no rain) = 1 - 0.28 = 0.72.

### Standard 7.SP.6 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting data on the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given the probability.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp6_coin_exp_001

**Prompt:** A coin is tossed 100 times and lands heads 52 times. What is the experimental probability of heads?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.52 [CORRECT]
- B. 0.48 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 0.48 is the experimental probability of tails! We're looking for the heads count this time.
- C. 52 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 52 is how many times it happened, but probability needs to be written as "52 out of 100" or 0.52.
- D. 5.2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with labels! 52 out of 100 is 0.52, not 5.2. Remember, experimental probabilities always stay between 0 and 1!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 0.52

**Explanation:** Experimental probability is favorable outcomes over total outcomes: 52/100 = 0.52.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp6_spinner_exp_001

**Prompt:** A spinner lands on red 18 times in 60 spins. What is the experimental probability of red?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0.30 [CORRECT]
- B. 0.70 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 0.70 is the probability of *not* landing on red. We're looking for the red result here.
- C. 0.18 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It looks like it was calculated as if there were 100 spins. Let's try 18 divided by 60 instead!
- D. 3.33 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the division was done backwards. We want the successes (18) divided by the total number of tries (60).

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 0.30

**Explanation:** Compute 18/60 and simplify: 3/10 = 0.30.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp6_long_run_001

**Prompt:** As the number of trials in a random experiment increases, experimental probability usually:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Moves farther away from theoretical probability. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It's actually the opposite: the more we try it, the more the "randomness" evens out and starts to look like the math theory!
- B. Becomes exactly equal to theoretical probability after 10 trials. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 10 trials is still a very small group. We need many more shots for the results to match the theory perfectly.
- C. Tends to get closer to theoretical probability. [CORRECT]
- D. Has no relationship to theoretical probability. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! They are tied together. Experimental results are our best way to *check* if our theoretical model is actually working!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Tends to get closer to theoretical probability.

**Explanation:** In the long run, relative frequency tends to approach the theoretical probability.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp6_predict_count_001

**Prompt:** If the probability of an event is 0.35, about how many times should it occur in 200 trials?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 70 [CORRECT]
- B. 35 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 35 would be right if there were only 100 trials. Since we have 200, we need to double that expectation!
- C. 130 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 130 is the number of times we expect the event *won't* happen. Let's find the 0.35 part instead.
- D. 57 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It looks like there was a small error in the calculation. Let's try 0.35 times 200 one more time.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 70

**Explanation:** Expected relative frequency is probability x number of trials: 0.35 x 200 = 70.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp6_compare_trials_001

**Prompt:** Two students estimate P(heads) for a fair coin. Student A tosses 20 times and gets 0.60. Student B tosses 400 times and gets 0.51. Which estimate is generally more reliable?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Student A, because 0.60 is farther from 0.5. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Just being further away doesn't mean it's better. Student A might have just had a short lucky streak of extra heads!
- B. Student B, because more trials usually reduce random fluctuation. [CORRECT]
- C. Both are equally reliable because both used random tosses. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While both procedures were correct, a much larger number of trials (400 vs 20) makes the result much more trustworthy.
- D. Neither is useful because experimental probability cannot estimate true probability. [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Experimental results are a fantastic way to estimate the truth—especially when you do a lot of trials like Student B did!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Student B, because more trials usually reduce random fluctuation.

**Explanation:** Larger trial counts generally produce more stable relative frequencies, so Student B's estimate is typically more reliable.

### Standard 7.SP.7 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp7_001

**Prompt:** A fair die is rolled once. Model probability of rolling 5 is:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/6 [CORRECT]
- B. 1/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! A standard die has *six* sides, so the total on the bottom of our fraction must be a 6!
- C. 5/6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 5/6 is the probability of rolling *anything except* a five. We're looking just for the five!
- D. 1/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! 1/2 is the probability of rolling something like an even or odd number. For one specific side, it's 1 out of 6.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 1/6

**Explanation:** One favorable face out of six equally likely outcomes gives 1/6.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp7_002

**Prompt:** A bag has 3 red and 2 blue marbles. Model probability of drawing red is:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/5 [CORRECT]
- B. 2/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 2/5 is the probability for choosing a blue marble. The question asks for red instead!
- C. 3/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Probability can never be larger than 1! Let's put the red count (3) over the total count (5).
- D. 1/5 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since there are three different red marbles to pick, you have three chances to get one, not just one.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 3/5

**Explanation:** There are 5 total marbles and 3 favorable red marbles, so probability is 3/5.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp7_003

**Prompt:** A spinner model predicts P(green)=0.25. In 20 spins, green appears 9 times. Which is the best explanation of the difference?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. The model must be wrong in every case [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Just because the result didn't match perfectly this once doesn't mean the whole model is broken. It could just be a lucky streak!
- B. Random variation in a small number of trials [CORRECT]
- C. Probability guarantees exact outcomes every time [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! Probability tells us what to expect over the "long run," but short-run results can be very unpredictable.
- D. Green is impossible on this spinner [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since we actually saw green happen 9 times, we know it's definitely possible!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Random variation in a small number of trials

**Explanation:** Expected count is 0.25 x 20 = 5, but random variation can produce different short-run results like 9.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp7_004

**Prompt:** A model predicts heads with probability 0.5. In 1000 tosses, 502 heads occur. Best conclusion?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Observed frequency is reasonably consistent with the model [CORRECT]
- B. The coin is definitely biased [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 502 out of 1000 is still extremely close to one-half. A small difference like that is just a normal part of random chance.
- C. Model probability should be changed to 0.502 exactly [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. We don't have to rewrite the rules after just one experiment. Our results show the "fair coin" model is still very reliable!
- D. No probability model can be used for coins [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Coins are actually the perfect example for learning about how probability models work.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Observed frequency is reasonably consistent with the model

**Explanation:** 502/1000 = 0.502, which is very close to 0.5, so this supports the model.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp7_005

**Prompt:** A game claims win probability 0.7. You observe 21 wins in 50 games. Which statement is most reasonable?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Observed 0.42 is far below 0.7, so investigate model assumptions and game fairness [CORRECT]
- B. 0.42 is essentially equal to 0.7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 0.42 and 0.70 are quite different. When the gap is that big, it usually means the model might not be right!
- C. Model is proven correct [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. In fact, our experimental data (21/50) actually suggests the game might not be as easy to win as it claims.
- D. Probability models are never useful [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! They are super useful—they are what allowed us to spot that this game might be hiding something!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Observed 0.42 is far below 0.7, so investigate model assumptions and game fairness

**Explanation:** Observed frequency 21/50 = 0.42 is much lower than 0.7, suggesting possible model mismatch or non-random effects.

### Standard 7.SP.8 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7sp8_001

**Prompt:** Two fair coins are tossed. What is P(exactly one head)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! There are actually two ways to get one head: HT or TH. That gives us 2 chances out of 4 total!
- B. 1/2 [CORRECT]
- C. 3/4 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 3/4 is the chance for "at least one head." We're looking for ONLY one head!
- D. 2/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! With two coins, there are four possible outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT) to count as our "whole" total.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/2

**Explanation:** Outcomes are HH, HT, TH, TT. Exactly one head is HT or TH: 2 out of 4 = 1/2.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7sp8_002

**Prompt:** A fair die is rolled and a fair coin is tossed. What is P(rolling an even number and getting heads)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 1/6 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! That might be the chance for just one event. Don't forget we're combining both the die roll AND the coin toss together!
- B. 1/4 [CORRECT]
- C. 1/3 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Think of it like this: half our die results are even (1/2), and half of those will also have heads (1/2). Half of a half is 1/4!
- D. 1/12 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with the counts! There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on the die. So we have 3 winning outcomes out of 12 total possibilities.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/4

**Explanation:** P(even)=3/6=1/2 and P(heads)=1/2. Multiply independent events: 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7sp8_003

**Prompt:** A bag has 3 red and 2 blue marbles. Two marbles are drawn without replacement. What is P(both red)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 9/25 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like you assumed the first marble was put back. Since it stayed out, there are fewer red marbles left for the next pick!
- B. 3/10 [CORRECT]
- C. 6/25 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Don't forget that after you take one out, the bag only has 4 marbles left in total for the second draw!
- D. 1/2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! That estimate is a bit higher than the actual math. Let's try 3/5 times 2/4 to find the exact answer!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 3/10

**Explanation:** First red is 3/5, then red is 2/4. Product is 6/20 = 3/10.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7sp8_004

**Prompt:** Spinner A has 4 equal sectors with 1 green. Spinner B has 5 equal sectors with 2 green. What is P(green on both)?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 3/9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like the counts were added together. For two separate events happening at the same time, we'll want to multiply the odds!
- B. 1/10 [CORRECT]
- C. 2/9 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. When we multiply 4 sectors by 5 sectors, we get a total of 20 different possible combinations on the bottom.
- D. 3/20 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! For the top of our fraction, we multiply "1 green" times "2 greens," which gives us just 2 winning combinations out of 20.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1/10

**Explanation:** P(green on A)=1/4 and P(green on B)=2/5. For both: 1/4 x 2/5 = 2/20 = 1/10.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7sp8_005

**Prompt:** A simulation of rolling two fair dice 600 times produced sum 7 exactly 92 times. Best experimental probability estimate for sum 7 is:

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 92/600 [CORRECT]
- B. 1/7 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 7 is the *sum* we want, but the probability is the number of successes (92) over the total trials (600)!
- C. 7/600 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 7 is just the goal we're aiming for. We need to use the actual count (92) of how many times that sum actually happened!
- D. 600/92 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the fraction was flipped. Probability is always successes divided by the total number of tries!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 92/600

**Explanation:** Experimental probability is event frequency divided by total trials: 92/600.

### Standard 7.G.2 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g2_001

**Prompt:** Can a triangle be constructed with angle measures 60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60 degrees?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. No triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, this is perfect! Since the angles add up exactly to 180 degrees, it forms a perfect equilateral triangle.
- B. Exactly one shape type (equilateral), with many sizes [CORRECT]
- C. Exactly two different triangles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While you can only draw one *type* of shape (equilateral), you can make them in many different sizes!
- D. Infinite triangles of unrelated angle types [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Since the angles are already fixed at 60-60-60, every triangle you draw will be a resized version of that same exact shape.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Exactly one shape type (equilateral), with many sizes

**Explanation:** Angles determine the shape class; 60-60-60 gives equilateral triangles, scalable to many sizes.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g2_002

**Prompt:** Can a triangle be made with sides 2, 3, and 6?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Yes, one unique triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Remember our "Triangle Rule": any two sides added up must be longer than the third side. Here, 2 + 3 is only 5, which is too short to reach across a side that is 6 long!
- B. Yes, more than one triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Any way you tilt them, these sides simply won't reach each other to close the shape.
- C. No triangle [CORRECT]
- D. Only a right triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! For a right triangle, the sides have to follow the rule a² + b² = c². These numbers don't quite fit that pattern!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. No triangle

**Explanation:** 2 + 3 = 5, which is less than 6, so these sides cannot form a triangle.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g2_003

**Prompt:** Given three side lengths 5, 5, and 8, how many non-congruent triangles are possible?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 0 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This triangle *can* be built because any two sides (like 5 + 5) are longer than the third side (8)!
- B. 1 [CORRECT]
- C. 2 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Once we have three fixed side lengths, there's only one way they can fit together into a triangle. Every version will be a twin of the first!
- D. Infinitely many [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! If we only had the degrees, we could make many sizes. But since the lengths are set, the size is already locked in!

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 1

**Explanation:** With three fixed side lengths that satisfy triangle inequality, SSS determines one congruent triangle.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g2_004

**Prompt:** You are given angles 40 degrees and 50 degrees and one side length. Which is true?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. No triangle is possible [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, it's possible! Since we know two angles, the third one just has to be 90 degrees to reach our 180-degree goal!
- B. Exactly one triangle size and shape is determined [CORRECT]
- C. Angles determine infinitely many unrelated shapes [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite! Because we also have one fixed side length, it "anchors" the triangle so only one specific size can exist.
- D. Exactly two non-congruent triangles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! With two angles and one side already chosen, there's only one way left to finish building the rest of the triangle.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Exactly one triangle size and shape is determined

**Explanation:** Angles are fixed (third is 90), and one side sets scale, so one unique triangle results.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g2_005

**Prompt:** Which condition set guarantees a unique triangle?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Only three angles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! This tells us the shape, but not the size—we could draw a tiny version or a huge version and they'd both have those angles!
- B. Only one side [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Just knowing one side length doesn't tell us how to tilt the other two sides or where they should meet up.
- C. Three side lengths [CORRECT]
- D. One angle only [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Knowing one corner doesn't give us enough info about the other parts of the shape or how long the sides should be.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Three side lengths

**Explanation:** Three valid side lengths (SSS) determine a unique triangle up to congruence.

### Standard 7.G.3 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Describe the two-dimensional figures that result from slicing three-dimensional figures, as in plane sections of right rectangular prisms and right rectangular pyramids.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g3_001

**Prompt:** A right rectangular prism is sliced parallel to its base. What shape is the cross-section?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Rectangle [CORRECT]
- B. Triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! If you cut a standard box parallel to the bottom, the slice will look exactly like a smaller version of the rectangular base!
- C. Circle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since a rectangular prism has only straight sides, a single flat cut will always result in a flat-edged shape like a rectangle.
- D. Pentagon [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! A rectangular prism doesn't have the right corners to create a 5-sided pentagon from a simple parallel cut.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Rectangle

**Explanation:** A slice parallel to a rectangular base of a right prism gives a rectangle.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g3_002

**Prompt:** A right rectangular pyramid is sliced by a plane through the apex and midpoint of the base edge. Which section is most likely?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Triangle [CORRECT]
- B. Rectangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Any cut that starts at the very top point (the apex) and goes straight down will usually give you a triangular cross-section.
- C. Circle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since pyramids are made from flat triangular faces, any straight cut will have straight edges, not a curve like a circle.
- D. Hexagon [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! A 6-sided hexagon is much too complex for a single slice through the simple triangular point of a pyramid.

**Correct Answer(s):** A. Triangle

**Explanation:** A plane through the apex and base region of a pyramid commonly forms a triangular cross-section.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g3_003

**Prompt:** Which cross-section cannot come from slicing a right rectangular prism?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Rectangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Actually, this is the most common result you'll see when slicing a box-like shape!
- B. Parallelogram [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. If you slice through the prism at an angle, you can definitely create a parallelogram shape.
- C. Circle [CORRECT]
- D. Square [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! A square is just a special type of rectangle, so you'll see it any time you cut through a cube-like prism.

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Circle

**Explanation:** A rectangular prism has only flat faces; any planar slice will have straight edges, so a circle is impossible.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g3_004

**Prompt:** A right rectangular pyramid is sliced parallel to its base. What shape is the cross-section?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While the "sides" are triangles, slice parallel to the base will look just like a smaller version of the rectangular base!
- B. Rectangle [CORRECT]
- C. Circle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Since the pyramid is made of straight-edged faces, our slice will always have four straight sides.
- D. Trapezoid [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! You can get a trapezoid if you slice at an angle, but a slice perfectly parallel to the base will always be a rectangle.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Rectangle

**Explanation:** Parallel slices of a rectangular pyramid mimic the base shape (rectangles).

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g3_005

**Prompt:** If you slice a cube diagonally from one top corner to the opposite bottom corner, what type of shape do you most likely get?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Triangle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! While it seems like it might be a triangle, a cut from top corner to bottom corner of a box actually touches four different faces, creating a rectangle!
- B. Rectangle [CORRECT]
- C. Square [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. While the slice will have four sides, that diagonal cut is actually longer than the sides of the cube, making it a non-square rectangle.
- D. Circle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Slicing through a flat-faced cube will always give you a shape with straight edges, never a curved circle.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. Rectangle

**Explanation:** A diagonal cut across a cube often results in a rectangular cross-section that is wider than it is tall.

### Standard 7.G.5 (Grade 7) - 5 questions

**Standard Statement:** Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure.

#### Q1 - q_mst_7g5_001

**Prompt:** Angles A and B are complementary. If A = 35 degrees, what is B?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 55 degrees [CORRECT]
- B. 65 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Complementary angles add up to 90 degrees. It looks like the math was just a tiny bit off during the subtraction.
- C. 145 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. 145 degrees is what you'd get if the angles were supplementary (adding to 180). Complementary angles add to just 90!
- D. 35 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! These angles aren't "twins" (vertical)—they are a pair that adds up to a right angle!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 55 degrees

**Explanation:** Complementary angles sum to 90. 90 - 35 = 55.

#### Q2 - q_mst_7g5_002

**Prompt:** Two angles are vertical and one is 112 degrees. What is the other?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 112 degrees [CORRECT]
- B. 68 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! 68 is what you'd find if they were supplementary (on a straight line). Vertical angles are "mirror twins" and are always equal!
- C. 224 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. It seems the angle was doubled. Vertical angles simply match each other—no math needed!
- D. 56 degrees [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! It seems the angle was cut in half by mistake. Remember our rule: Vertical angles are always identical!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 112 degrees

**Explanation:** Vertical angles are equal.

#### Q3 - q_mst_7g5_003

**Prompt:** A straight line is split into two angles. One is 4x and the other is 60 degrees. What is x?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 15 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! It looks like 4x was set equal to 60. Since they sit on a straight line, they should add up to 180 instead!
- B. 30 [CORRECT]
- C. 45 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Our equation should be 4x + 60 = 180. Let's solve that step-by-step!
- D. 120 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful with your final step! 120 is the value of 4x, but we're looking for what x itself equals.

**Correct Answer(s):** B. 30

**Explanation:** Supplementary angles sum to 180. 4x + 60 = 180 -> 4x = 120 -> x = 30.

#### Q4 - q_mst_7g5_004

**Prompt:** Two adjacent angles form a right angle. One is x+10 and the other is 40. What is x?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. 40 [CORRECT]
- B. 50 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! You're so close! You found the whole first angle, but remember to subtract that 10 to find out what x equals.
- C. 130 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. These angles form a *right* angle (90 degrees), not a straight line (180 degrees).
- D. 30 [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! Let's set up the equation: (x + 10) + 40 = 90. Solving that will lead us to the right x!

**Correct Answer(s):** A. 40

**Explanation:** (x + 10) + 40 = 90 -> x + 50 = 90 -> x = 40.

#### Q5 - q_mst_7g5_005

**Prompt:** Which pair of angles must sum to 180 degrees?

**Visual:** None

**Choices:**
- A. Complementary angles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Oops! Careful with those terms. Complementary angles are a smaller pair—they add up to just 90 degrees.
- B. Vertical angles [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Not quite. Vertical angles are "twins" (equal), but they don't necessarily have to add up to 180.
- C. Supplementary angles [CORRECT]
- D. Adjacent angles that form a right angle [WRONG]
  - Misconception: Careful! If they form a right angle, their sum will be 90 degrees, not 180!

**Correct Answer(s):** C. Supplementary angles

**Explanation:** By definition, supplementary angles sum to 180 degrees.
