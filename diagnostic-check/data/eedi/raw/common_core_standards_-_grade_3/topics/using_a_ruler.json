        "A": "This would be the length to the nearest inch, can you see the calculator is a little bit after the 6 inches... What is its length to the nearest quarter inch?",

        "C": "This measurement is a little longer than the calculator, it's equivalent to 6 1/2 inches. Look at the end of the calculator, what length is this to the nearest quarter inch?",

        "D": "We can see the start of the calculator is at 0 and the end is two marks before 8 inches. Each small mark on the scale is 1/8 inch, so this length is 7 6/8 inches, or 7 3/4 inches."
