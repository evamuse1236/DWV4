        "C": "The shaded piece is half of a larger section, but it's not half of the whole shape. How many of the blue shapes could you fit into the whole shape?",

        "D": "The numerator usually tells us how many parts to shade, not the denominator, so look at the 3... but because it's 3/5, we need to picture the shape split into 5 parts and shade 3 of those.
