        "D": "Division and multiplication are inverse operations. 12 ÷ 4 = ? is the same as asking ? x 4 = 12. We know that 3 x 4 = 12, which is the same as 4 x 3 = 12."

        "B": "This multiplication does equal 18, which is a good spot! However, to be the calculation that helps find 18 ÷ 6, it must also include the number 6.",
        "C": "Division and multiplication are inverse operations. This means that if 18 ÷ 6 = 3, then it must be true that 6 x 3 = 18. This multiplication uses the same three numbers.",
        "D": "You are right that the answer to 18 ÷ 6 is 3. A related multiplication fact must use all three numbers from the division fact family: 18, 6, and 3."
