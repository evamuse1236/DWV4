We can do 9+4=13, indicating that there must be some regrouping (borrowing) from the thousands column, but we need to check if any other borrowing has happened earlier. Starting with the units column: 0 − 6 isn't possible, so the top tens change from 2 to 1 and we have 10 − 6 = 4 in the units. The tens column is now 1 − 5, which we can't do, we borrow 1 from the top hundreds, which is ★, the tens answer becomes 11 − 5 = 6. On to the hundreds column, remembering we need to end up calculating 13 − 4 = 9, but that we borrowed 1 for our tens, means that ★ = 3+1 = 4.
