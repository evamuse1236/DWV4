        "A": "Making sure one of the lines of the angle goes through a zero on the protractor makes it easier to measure an angle. Diagram A is positioned in this way. It is not impossible to measure the angle with Diagram B but you would have to perform a calculation as well as measuring which makes it more difficult.",
        "B": "This way of measuring an angle would be quite difficult. To find the angle you would have to read off the measurements for both lines and subtract one from the other to work out the angle between them both.",
        "C": "The way of measuring an angle with B would be quite difficult. To find the angle you would have to read off the measurements for both lines and subtract one from the other to work out the angle between them both.",
        "D": "The easiest way to use a protractor is to have one line of the angle going through zero."

        "A": "The easiest way to measure an angle with a protractor is to make sure one line of the angle goes through one of the zeros on the protractor, either the one on the left, which means you measure using the outer scale, or the zero on the right, which means you measure using the inner scale.",

        "C": "A starting point of zero makes it easier to measure an angle. Both diagrams are positioned in this way. In each case, care should be taken to ensure the measurement is taken from the correct scale. Diagram A would measure using the outside scale, whereas Diagram B uses the inner scale.",
        "D": "The easiest way to measure an angle with a protractor is to make sure one line of the angle goes through one of the zeros on the protractor, either the one on the left, which means you measure using the outer scale, or the zero on the right, which means you measure using the inner scale."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Start at the 0° on the right-hand side, as this is where one of the lines goes through. Take care to use the inner scale because this is the one which increases from the 0° at the right-hand side. The other red line is between 60° and 70°, and is 5 small divisions more than 60° which means an angle of 65°.",

Alternatively, you can measure the part of the marked angle that can be measured using the protractor, 30°, and recognise that the rest of the angle is 180° as it creates a straight line, then you can add 180° and 30° to get 210° in total for the marked angle.",
