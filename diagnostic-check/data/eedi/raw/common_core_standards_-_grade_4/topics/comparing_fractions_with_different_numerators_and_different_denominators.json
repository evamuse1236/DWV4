This is not the case here. Try substituting in the values for a and b and then use equivalent fractions to give them common denominators so that you can compare them.",
        "D": "Not quite. There is enough information to work out what symbol the star should be. Try replacing the values of a and b with 3 and 4, and then find a common denominator, to see if these fractions are equal or if one is bigger than the other."
