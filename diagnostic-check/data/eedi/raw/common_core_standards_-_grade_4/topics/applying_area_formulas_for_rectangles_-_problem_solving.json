Subtracting this from 63 cm² gives us the area of the larger rectangle as 63 – 15 = 48 cm². The smaller rectangle is 3 cm wide and the whole shape is 7 cm wide so the larger rectangle must have a width of 7 – 3 = 4 cm. Dividing the area by the width gives us the missing length: 48 ÷ 4 = 12 cm.",

We can use this to help us find the missing side.",
