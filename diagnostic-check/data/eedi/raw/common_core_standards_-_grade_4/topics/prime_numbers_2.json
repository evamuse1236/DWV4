        "A": "I think we need to revise prime and square number definitions - try having another go using the fact that a prime number has exactly two factors, 1 AND itself (where itself is different), and that a square number is the result of one number multiplied by itself, for example 3x3=9, 9 is a square number :)",
        "B": "Square numbers are formed as a result of multiplying two identical whole numbers together. Since 1 ✕ 1 = 1, this fits the definition, and so 1 is a square number. It is not prime, though, because it does not have two distinct (or different) factors. It has only one factor.",
