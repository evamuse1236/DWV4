        "A": "The final stage of this long multiplication is the addition of the numbers 116 (found from 2 x 58) and 1160 (found from 20 x 58). Adding these together gives us an answer of 1276 which has a unit digit of 6.",
        "B": "I think you may have thought this because when we multiply by the '20' we put a 0 in the units column. However when we multiply by the '2' we will get another number which will contribute to the units column.",
        "C": "Be careful, I think you have added the 8 and the 2 together to get 10, but we are multiplying here",
        "D": "Not quite, 16 is a two digit number there will only be one number in the units column of the final answer."

        "A": "The final stage of this long multiplication is the addition of the numbers 210 (found from 6 x 35) and 1400 (found from 40 x 35). Adding these together gives us an answer of 1610 which has a unit digit of 0.",
        "B": "Be careful, I think you have added the 5 and the 6 together to get 11, but we are multiplying here",
        "C": "I think you may have thought this because one of the 4 calculations you have to do in this long multiplication is 6 x 3, which ends in an 8. But this calculation does not contribute to the units digit of the answer. Which of the 4 multipications will contribute to the units digit of your answer?",
        "D": "Not quite, 30 is a two digit number but there can only be one number in the units column of the final answer."

It shows the 7 has multiplied both the 0 and 8, it shows the additional 0 placed in the units column underneath the 0 in 560, it shows that the 2 has multiplied both the 8 and the zero in 80 and it shows the summation of 560 and 1600.",

        "C": "In the second row of the workings we are multiplying 45 by 30. This is the same as 45 x 3 with a zero on the end so we replace the star with a zero in the ones column. 5 x 3 tens is 15 tens so we write 5 in the tens column and carry over the 1 into the hundreds column. So the triangle is replaced by 1.",
        "D": "In the second row of the workings we are multiplying 45 by 30 and you are right that we need a zero in the ones column. Then we can do 45 x 3 (tens). We start by doing 5 x 3 tens which gives us 15 tens. How do we write this in the calculation?"

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "I think you might have assumed that we always carry 1s. But we need to work out each stage of the calculation to see exactly what needs to be carried over.",
        "B": "You are right that the second row of the workings 27 x 50 will give us 1350. Check the first row of workings carefully. We need 27 x 3 so we start by doing 7 x 3. How many ones will we have? And how many tens do we need to carry over?",
        "C": "You are right that the first row of the workings 27 x 3 will give us 81, so 2 tens have been carried over. Check the second row of workings carefully. We need 27 x 50. 2 tens x 5 tens will give us 10 tens but do we need to add in anything else here?",
        "D": "In the first row of the workings we are multiplying 27 by 3. 7 x 3 tens is 21 so we write 1 in the ones column and carry over the 2 tens into the tens column. So the triangle is replaced by 2. In the second row of working, we are multiplying 27 by 50. We put zero in the ones column and do 27 x 5 (tens). 7 x 5 tens is 35 tens so we have 5 in the tens column and 3 hundreds carried over. 2 tens x 5 tens is 10 hundreds. But we need to add the 3 hundreds that we carried over. So we have 13 hundreds. So the star is replaced by 3."
