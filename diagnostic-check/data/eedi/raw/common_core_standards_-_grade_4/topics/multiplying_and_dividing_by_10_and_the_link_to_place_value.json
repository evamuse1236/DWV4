        "A": "Try to say this number out loud, if you didn't have a 1 in front of the 2, what would the value be? You can also look at the number of digits after the 2 and compare, as there is no decimal point here.",
        "B": "The position of the digits within a number tells you the amount each contributes to the overall value of a number. Starting at the right-hand side of 12,030, the last digit 0 represents ones or units; the 3 tells us there are 3 tens, so 30; the next zero tells us there are 0 hundreds; and the 2 (the other side of the gap in the question) tells us there are 2 thousands, so 2,000.",
        "C": "I think you might have counted the zeros after the 2, remember the 3 has a place value as well.",
        "D": "Have a think about which column or place value the 2 has in the number. You could try ignoring the 1 and reading the number out loud to help."

        "A": "Make sure the 3 has not moved in place value. Is this the same position it has in 43075? It might help to say the number out loud, ignoring the numbers before 3.",

        "C": "I think you might have counted the zeros after the 3, remember the 7 and 5 hold a place value as well.",
        "D": "The position of the digits within a number tells you the amount each contributes to the overall value of a number. Starting at the right-hand side of 43,075, the last digit 5 represents ones or units, so 5 ones = 5; the 7 tells us there are 7 tens, so 70; the next zero tells us there are 0 hundreds; and the 3 (the other side of the gap in the question) tells us there are 3 thousands, so 3,000."

        "D": "The 103 is made of 1 hundred, 0 tens and 3 units. When multiplying by 10, the place value of each digit increases by a factor of 10, meaning 100 will become 1000, the 0 tens will become 0 hundreds, and 3 will become 30. This gives an answer of 1030.
