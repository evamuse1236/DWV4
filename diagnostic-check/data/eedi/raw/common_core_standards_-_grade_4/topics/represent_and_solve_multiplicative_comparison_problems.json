        "A": "This equation would mean the lizard's length divided by 9 is 54, which would make the lizard very long! We know the snake is longer than the lizard.",

        "D": "We know the snake's length (54 cm) is 9 times the lizard's length (star). This means star x 9 = 54. To find the lizard's length, we need to do the inverse operation, which is division: 54 ÷ 9 = star."

        "B": "The red ribbon is longer than the blue ribbon. If you multiply 45 by 5, you will get a very long ribbon! The red ribbon's length is the result of a multiplication, so to find the blue ribbon's length you need to divide.",

        "D": "The adult ticket costs more than the child's ticket. If you multiply 96 by 8, you'll get a very large number. This would mean the child's ticket is more expensive, which isn't right. You need to do the inverse of multiplying."
