        "A": "Not quite! A factor of a number is another number that divides into it exactly, leaving no remainder. There are numbers that you can divide into 11 that would leave no remainder.",
        "B": "Not quite! Remember a factor of a number is another number that divides into it exactly, leaving no remainder.",
        "C": "The number 11 is a prime number. By definition, this means that the only factors it has are 1 and itself, which means a total of two factors.",
        "D": "Good try! 11 is a factor of 11, but the question is asking you to find the number of factors that 11 has."

        "A": "This will always be true as square numbers have a repeated factor. For example, 16 = 1 ✕ 16, 2 ✕ 8 and 4 ✕ 4 so the factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 with 4 only being included once in the list.",
