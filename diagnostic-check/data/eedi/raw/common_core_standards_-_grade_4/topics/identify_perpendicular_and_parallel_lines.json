        "C": "Parallel lines stay the same distance apart forever. Perpendicular lines meet at 90°. Are either of these true for this diagram?",
        "D": "Lines are parallel if they have the same slope and therefore never meet. We use arrows to indicate lines are parallel. Perpendicular means two lines meet at right angles to each other, a small square at the point of intersection would tell us that lines meet at 90° . As we cannot see arrows or a small square both Tom and Katie are incorrect. The dashes on these lines tell us they are equal in length."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Tom is correct as the dash symbol means that the lines are of equal length. Perpendicular means two lines meet at right angles to each other, a small square at the point of intersection would tell us that lines meet at 90°. As this cannot be seen on the diagram Katie is incorrect.",
        "B": "Not quite. Remember perpendicular means the lines intersect at an angle of 90°. Can we tell what angle these lines intersect at? How can we tell if lines are equal in length?",
        "C": "Not quite. Remember two lines are perpendicular if they meet at 90°. Can we tell what angles these lines intersect at?",
        "D": "Not quite, at least one of the students is correct. Look at the diagram, do thes dashes mean the lines are equal in length or that they are perpendicular, meet at 90°?"
