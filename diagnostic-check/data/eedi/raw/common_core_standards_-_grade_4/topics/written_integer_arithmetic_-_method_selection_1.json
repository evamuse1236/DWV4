To find the cost of 3 pizzas, you needed to multiply this by 3. In the future, remember to check you've completed all the steps! :)",

You have successfully recognised that it will be necessary to multiply by 3! :) However, you've missed out the first step: the thing you need to multiply by 3 is the cost of 1 pizza, rather than 5 pizzas.
