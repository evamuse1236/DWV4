        "A": "We have £3000 × 1.04³ = £3374.59.",
        "B": "It looks like you might have found the value of the interest only by calculating 4% of 3000 and then multiplying by 4. Notice that this is compound interest and not simple interest. When interest is compounded you need to use a different method because after the first year the interest is added to the initial amount, then the next year's interest is worth more.",

        "A": "It looks like you may have used simple interest and given your answer as the interest earned. When interest is compounded you need to use a different method because after the first year the interest is added to the initial amount, then the next year's interest is worth more.",
        "B": "The investment was £2000 and it was invested for 3 years at 3%. We can work this out by calculating 2000×1.03×1.03×1.03, or to be more efficient we can use powers. £2000× 1.03³ = £2185.45.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "It looks like you might have worked out the interest as if the amount earned each year is the same. With compound interest the interest at the end of the first year is added to the account so in the second year the interest is different. Can you think of a formula to use for this?",
        "B": "We have an interest rate of 5% which is a multiplier of 1.05. The money is in the account for 4 years so we raise the multiplier to the power of 4 and multiply by £13000. This gives us the total in the account at the end of 4 years. Finally we subtract the initial amount invested to see what the interest is that has been paid :£13000 × 1.05⁴ - £13000 = £2801.58.",

        "D": "We have a 10% discount which is a multiplier of 0.9, and then a further 5% discount which is a multiplier of 0.95. Overall we have 0.9 × 0.95 = 0.855. Then we work out 1 - 0.855 = 0.145, or a 14.5% discount."
