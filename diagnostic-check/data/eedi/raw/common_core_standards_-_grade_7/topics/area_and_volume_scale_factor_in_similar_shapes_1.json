        "A": "Nearly! I think you have calculated the length scale factor, of 2.5, then divided the given volume by this. Remember we need to use the volume scale factor to do these calculations.",
        "B": "First we need to work out the length scale factor, which is 15 ÷ 6 = 2.5. Now, we need the volume scale factor, which is 2.5³. So, to find the volume it is 1800 ÷ 2.5³ = 115.2ml.",
        "C": "Nearly! I think you have multiplied 1800 by 2.5³ instead of dividing, notice that you need to find the volume of the smaller cylinder.",
        "D": "I think you have calculated the length scale factor by doing 15 - 6. Instead of this, think about how many times bigger 15 is than 6. This will give you the length scale factor. Once you have this, can you find the volume scale factor?"

        "D": "To get from the base length on shape Q, 15cm, to the base length on shape P, 5cm, we need to divide by 3. This is the same as multiplying by one third. Therefore, the length scale factor is 1/3."
