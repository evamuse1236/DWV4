Ratios (1) and (2) are both already in their simplest form and are not the same, so Tom is not correct. Simplify (3) 6:12, to check if Katie is correct.",

        "D": "Ratios 4:9 and 2:3 are already in their simplest form. Ratio 6:12 simplifies to 1:2. As none of these simplified ratios are the same there are no equivalent ratios in the question so both Tom and Katie are incorrect."

If you check the numbers in the bottom row of this table you will spot that it has 28 chocolate milks for 4 strawberry, but the question states 28 chocolate milks for 7 strawberry milks. As not all the tables have 28 in the chocolates column, we can think about the ratio 28 : 7 and simplify it. How many chocolate milks are sold for each strawberry milk?",

Each pair of numbers in table B (2 : 6, 3 : 9, 4 : 12) simplifies to 1 : 3 and so all show the relationship between the sales of these types of chocolate.",
        "C": "Not quite - I see the first numbers in this table look correct, and if I write them as 8 : 24 and simplify it I see that for each dark chocolate bar sold the store sold 3 milk chocolates. This means that the number in the milk chocolate column needs to be 3 times more than the number in the dark chocolates column. The other pairs of numbers in this table do not have this proportion.",
        "D": "With the first number in the dark chocolate column, 8, we should then have 24 milk chocolates, not 3. I think you spotted that 8 x 3 = 24. This means that the number in the milk chocolate column needs to be 3 times more than the number in the dark chocolates column..."
