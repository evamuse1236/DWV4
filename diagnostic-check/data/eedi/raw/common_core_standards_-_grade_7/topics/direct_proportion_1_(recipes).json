        "B": "The recipe makes enough for 4 people, but we only want enough for 1 person. To get from 4 down to 1, we need to divide by 4. 60g of almonds divided by 4 gives us 15g of ground almonds.",

        "A": "First we need to work out how much margarine is needed for 1 cake (180g divided by 12 = 15g). Then we can work out how many cakes 450g of margarine will make (450 divided by 15 = 30). You could also do this by working out how much is needed for half a batch and spotting that we could make 2 and a half batches.",

        "C": "We need 200g of flour for 12 cakes.If we halve these quantities, we would need 100g of flour for 6 cakes. So 300g of flour must make 12+6 cakes or 18 cakes. This is easier than working out how much flour is needed per cake as we would have to work with decimals.",
