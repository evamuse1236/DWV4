        "A": "The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr². You can see this from the diagram because we have an approximation of a rectangle where the length is πr (half of the circumference) and the height is r (the radius). So the area would be πr²",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr². You can see this from the diagram because the base of the triangle is the length of the longest strip (circumference) and the height tends towards the radius. To find the area of the triangle we would multiply these together and divide by 2. Giving us (2πr x r ) / 2 = πr²",
        "B": "This is the length of the longest strip (circumference). What other elements of the diagram could be used to get the area formula?",
