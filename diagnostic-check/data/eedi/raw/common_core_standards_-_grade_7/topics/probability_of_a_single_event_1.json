        "A": "Be careful! Remember the probability of an event happening must always be between 0 and 1. Which of these means no chance of the event happening? Which means an event will definitely happen?",
        "B": "Watch out! If something is unlikely to happen this isn't the same as saying the chance of something happening is impossible. With 'unlikely' there is still a tiny chance of the event occurring.",
        "C": "Remember, probabilities range from 0 to 1. I think you may be thinking that probabilities range from -1 to 1.",
        "D": "The lowest a probability can be is 0, so the event is impossible."

        "A": "The lowest a probability can be is 0, this signals an impossible event.",

        "C": "Not quite! It feels sensible that a very low number such as 0.00000001 could be the correct answer, but an event with the probability of 0.00000001 still has a  very small chance of occurring.",
        "D": "Not quite! Probabilities can only range from 0 to 1, therefore we cannot use infinity to indicate the probability of an event occurring."
