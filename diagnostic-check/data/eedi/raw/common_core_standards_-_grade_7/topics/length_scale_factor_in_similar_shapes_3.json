        "C": "Nearly! I think you have correctly subtracted 80 from 180, but maybe you forgot that we only want to find one of the base angles? Or maybe you used the scale factor of 2? Make sure the angles in each triangle still add up to 180 degrees.",
        "D": "As the triangles are similar, the top angle in D is 80°. The triangle is isosceles so the 2 base angles are equal. This means that b is (180 - 80)/2 = 50°."
