        "A": "I think you have assumed that because there are two outcomes, they must have an even chance of occurring. The probability of all of the outcomes added together must be 1. If the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet is 0.8, what must the probability of choosing an orange sweet be?",

        "C": "The probability of all of the outcomes of an event must sum to 1. There are two outcomes for this event – strawberry or orange. The probability of choosing strawberry is 0.8 So the probability of choosing orange is 1-0.8=0.2",

        "A": "I think you have assumed there would be an equal chance of choosing each of the three outcomes. The outcomes of all 3 events must sum to 1. The question states that the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet is 0.8. What would the probability of the other two possible outcomes be?",
        "B": "I think you have assumed that the remaining probability would be shared out equally between the orange and blackcurrant sweets. It does not specify that this is the case in the question. Can you calculate the probability of choosing orange without knowing how many there are?",
        "C": "I think you have forgotten to account for the blackcurrant sweets. If the probability of orange was 0.2 then the probability of blackcurrant would be 0, which cannot be the case as we are told there are blackcurrant sweets in the bag. The outcomes of all 3 events must sum to 1. The question states that the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet is 0.8. What would the probability of the other two possible outcomes be?",
        "D": "Without knowing how many sweets there are in the bag, or being given information on how the remaining 0.2 is shared between blackcurrant and orange, it is impossible to know the probability of choosing either."
