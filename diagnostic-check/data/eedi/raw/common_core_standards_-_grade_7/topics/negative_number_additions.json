        "C": "If you start at -12 on a number line and add 12, you move 12 places in the positive direction (to the right). This takes you exactly back to 0. A number and its opposite always add up to zero.",
        "D": "The question asks you to add 12 to -12. This means moving 12 steps in the positive direction (to the right) from -12. It looks like you might have subtracted 12 instead, moving in the negative direction."
