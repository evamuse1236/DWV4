        "B": "You may have thought that because there are fewer greens that they take up less space. Compare the lengths of the green and red tiles. If an extra one of each is added to the diagram which section will be longer?",
        "C": "You may have just looked at the numbers in front of the letters. We have to see what each letter represents by thinking about the length of each bar. You may have just got your inequalities the wrong way round. Remember the opening of the inequality symbol is by the greater value.",
        "D": "Considering Tom’s statement, 5g > 4p, we can see from the diagram that the purple tiles (p) are longer than the green tiles (g). Therefore if we added an extra purple tile and an extra green tile the purple section would be longer. This shows that 4p > 5g. Considering Katie's statement, 5g < 7r, we can see from the diagram that the green tiles (g) are longer than the red tiles (r). Therefore if we added an extra green tile and an extra red tile the green section would be longer. This shows that 5g > 7r. Therefore neither of them are correct as their inequalities are the wrong way round."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "You may not have expanded the brackets correctly. 3(r+w) means 3 lots of r plus 3 lots of w and can be written as 3r + 3w. Now use the diagram to work out whether 3 red tiles and 3 white tiles would be shorter than 3 purple tiles.",
        "B": "For Jo’s statement, 6g < 4p, you'd need to add one more purple tile (p) and two more green tiles (g) to the diagram. From the diagram we can see that 2 green tiles are longer than one purple tile so 6g would be greater than 4p. You could also divide Jo's statement by 2 and get 3g < 2p and from the diagram we can clearly see that 3 greens are in fact greater than 2 purples. Expanding the brackets from Paul’s statement gives 3r ＋ 3w < 3p, and it can be seen from the diagram that 3 red tiles and 3 white tiles are less than 3 purple tiles so it is a true statement.",
        "C": "You may have thought that because the greens are smaller they take up less space in total. Compare the lengths of the green and purple tiles. If an extra purple was added and 2 extra greens were added which section would be longer? You could also simplify Jo's statement by halving the values to get 3g < 2p. Use the diagram to see if this is correct.",
        "D": "You may have just looked at the numbers in front of the letters. We have to see what each letter represents by thinking about the length of each bar. Alternatively you may have just got your inequalities the wrong way round. Remember the opening of the inequality symbol is by the greater value."

Tom’s statement is not always true: it is for positive values but not negative amounts. An example of a set of negative values that fit the original equation are x = −6, y = −2.
