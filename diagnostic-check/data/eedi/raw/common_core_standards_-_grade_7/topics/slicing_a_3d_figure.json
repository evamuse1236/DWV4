        "A": "You're correct that the cross-section is a 4 sided shape with 4 right-angles. But we are not told that the height and width of the prism are equal, so the cross-section cannot be a square.",
        "B": "The cross-section, shown in purple, has 4 angles. The angle at each corner of the cross-section is a right-angle because the angles between faces of a right-rectangular prism are right-angles. Therefore the cross-section is a 4 sided shape with 4 right-angles, so it must be a square or a rectangle. We are not told that the height and width of the prism are equal, so the cross-section cannot be a square, it is a rectangle.",
        "C": "Although the drawing looks like a rhombus, this is a 2D representation of a 3D shape, so the cross-section will look different in 3D. Think about the angle between each pair of joined faces in a right-rectangular prism. This is the size of the angle at each of the corners of the cross-section, this will help you to name the shape.",

Think about the angle between each pair of joined faces in a cube. This is the size of the angle at each of the corners of the cross-section, this will help you to name the shape..",
        "C": "The cross-section, shown in yellow, has 4 angles. Each of its angles are shared with an angle between 2 faces of the cube, which are right angles. Therefore the cross-section is a 4 sided shape with 4 right-angles, so it must be a square or a rectangle. The sides of the cross-section are all equal because they are all the height or width of the cube. This cross-section is a square.",
        "D": "A cube is the 3D shape we're starting with. The cross-section is a 2D slice of the cube, so we're looking for the name of a 2D shape. Think about the angle between each pair of joined faces in a cube. This is the size of the angle at each of the corners of the cross-section."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "We can see that the cross-section has two pairs of parallel sides. The angle at each corner of the cross-section is a right-angle because the angles between faces of a cube are right-angles. Two of the cross-sections sides are the same length as the edges of the cube. The other two sides are slightly longer because the diagonal of a square or rectangle is always longer than its sides. Therefore, the cross-section is a rectangle.",
        "B": "You may be thinking that the cross-section is the same size and shape as one of the faces of the cube. Have another look at the sides that go diagonally across the face of the cube. What do we know about the length of the diagonals of a square, when compared to the length of its sides?",

The angle at each corner of the cross-section is a right-angle because the angles between joined faces of a right-rectangular prism are right-angles. So, we're looking for the name of a 2D shape with 4 sides and 4 right-angles in the available options. Therefore, the cross-section must be a rectangle.",
