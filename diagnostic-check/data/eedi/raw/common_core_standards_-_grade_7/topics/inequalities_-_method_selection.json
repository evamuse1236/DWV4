In negative numbers, a value is counted as smaller if it is 'more negative' than another. Try substituting in the value for 𝑑 into each inequality and then deciding which side is smaller, and therefore does this match what is being expressed.",

        "C": "Correct. Substituting the value 𝑑 = −5 into Inequality 1 gives −4.9 ≥ −5, which is correct because −4.9 is less negative than −5, so −5 is less than −4.9. Substituting the value 𝑑 = −5 into Inequality 2 gives −5 > −5.1, which is also correct because this time −5 is less negative than −5.1 so −5.1 is less than −5. So both inequalities apply.",

        "D": "Correct. Substituting the value 𝑑 = −6 into Inequality 1 gives −6 > −5.47, which is incorrect because −5.47 is less negative than −6, so −6 is smaller than −5.47. Inequality 2 gives −6.47 ≥ −6., which is also incorrect because this time −6 is less negative than −6.47, so −6.47 is smaller than −6. Neither inequality applies."

Repeating this process for Inequality 2, the middle part gives (𝑑 − 1)/2 = (5 − 1)/2 = 2, and so we now need to ask whether 8 < 2 ≤ 12 is true: it isn’t because 2 is not greater than 8.
