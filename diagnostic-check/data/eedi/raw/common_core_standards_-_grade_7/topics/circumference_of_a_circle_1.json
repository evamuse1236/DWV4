        "C": "Both are correct because the diameter is twice the length of the radius, so 𝑑 = 2𝑟. Substituting 2𝑟 into Tom’s formula in place of 𝑑, we have 𝐶 = 𝜋𝑑 = 𝜋 × 2𝑟 = 2π𝑟.",
        "D": "Not quite! Perhaps you're confusing these formulae with the area of a circle, which is 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² (Note the ² here, also used for units of area such as 𝑐𝑚². This may help you remember which is which.) The circumference is a measurement of length."

        "A": "Not quite, this is the formula for the area of a circle. How do we find the circumference of a circle?",
        "B": "Katie is correct because to find the circumference of a circle you multiply the diameter of the circle by pi. The radius is 2 lots of the diameter, therefore 𝐶 = 𝜋𝑑 = 𝜋 × 2𝑟 = 2π𝑟. Tom is incorrect because his formula finds the area of a circle.",
        "C": "Not quite. These two formulae are not equivalent. Tom's formula includes an r² where as Katie's formula only has an r. Which, if any, of these formulae find the circumference of a circle?",
        "D": "Not quite at least one person is correct. Remember circumference is a measure of length not area."
