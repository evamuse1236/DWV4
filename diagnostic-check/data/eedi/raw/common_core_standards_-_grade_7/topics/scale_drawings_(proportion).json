        "A": "Not quite! The scale 1:10 means for every 1 cm on the drawing the object is 10cm tall in real life. This would make the Eiffel tower 30cm tall, or about the same height as a ruler you might use at school. This isn't a sensible answer, so think about which scale might give us a more realistic answer.",
        "B": "Not quite! I think you have ignored the units here. When reading map scales, 1:100 means for every 1 cm on the drawing the object is 100cm (or 1m) tall in real life. This would make the Eiffel tower 3m tall, or just a bit taller than the room you are currently sitting in. This isn't a sensible answer, so think about which scale might give us a more realistic answer.",
        "C": "Not quite! The scale 1:1000 means for every 1 cm on the drawing the object is 1000cm (or 10m) tall in real life. This would make the Eiffel tower 30m tall. This is pretty tall, however the Eiffel tower is the tallest building in the enitre city of Paris, and so is much taller than this. Think about which scale might give us a more realistic estimate.",
        "D": "The scale 1:10,000 means for every 1 cm on the drawing the object is 10,000cm (or 100m) tall in real life.This ratio means that the Eiffel Tower is approximately 300 m tall, which is the most realistic answer."
