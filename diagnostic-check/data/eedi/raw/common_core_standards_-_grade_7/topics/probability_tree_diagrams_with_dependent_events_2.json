        "A": "Have another think. The maximum value a probability can be is 1, therefore this answer doesn't make sense. It looks like you have added the probabilities of passing together, however we need to also take into account the probability of arriving on time or late in our calculations. Remember to multiply along each branch",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite! You seem to have multiplied the probability of a pass from each branch, however we need to work our way along each branch first. 0.4 x 0.9 gives us the probability he will pass if the bus is on time. What is the probability he will pass if the bus is late?",
        "B": "The probability that Ben passes the test if the bus is on time is 0.4 × 0.9 = 0.36. The probability that Ben passes the test if the bus is late is 0.6 X 0.8 = 0.48. Adding these together gives 0.84",

Similarly the probability of yellow yellow is 3/8 ✕ 2/7 = 6/56. Adding these probabilities together we get 26/56.",
