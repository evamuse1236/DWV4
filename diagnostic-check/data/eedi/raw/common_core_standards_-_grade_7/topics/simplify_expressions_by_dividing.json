        "A": "Not quite! I think you have done the division the wrong way around. We are dividing 3m² by 12m³.",

        "C": "I think you have misread the power of m on the numerator. The numerator is m² which means m x m and the denominator is m³ which means m x m x m. They would not cancel each other out completely.",

        "D": "I think you have made a numerical error with the coefficients. Do they share a common factor? What are we left with if we divide them by this common factor? You have also cancelled out a y², but there is no y on the numerator to enable us to do this."
