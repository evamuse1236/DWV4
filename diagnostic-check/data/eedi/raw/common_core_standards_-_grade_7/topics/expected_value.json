        "D": "The probability of getting a 5 when we roll a fair 6 sided dice is 1 out of 6. To find the expected value we multiply the probability by the number of times we roll. So 90 multiplied by 1 out of 6 is the same as doing 90 divided by 6 which is 15. So we would expect to get 15 fives when we roll a fair dice 90 times."
