        "C": "The triangular prism has 5 faces. It has a uniform cross section of an isosceles triangle, which means that it has two pairs of equal faces: the two sloping faces and the two triangular faces. Therefore, one way of calculating the surface area is to find the area of the rectangular sloping face and multiply this value by 2, so 2 × 11 × 5, then find the area of the isosceles triangle and multiply this by 2, so 2 × ½ × 6 × 4 = 6 × 4, and lastly to these two calculations, add the area of the base, so add 11 × 6. This is the calculation that is shown in answer C.",
