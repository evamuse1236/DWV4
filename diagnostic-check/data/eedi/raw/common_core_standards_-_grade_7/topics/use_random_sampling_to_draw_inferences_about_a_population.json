        "B": "I think you might have estimated based on the pizza's popularity. But we can be more specific. 4/15 people liked Margarita pizzas in the sample. How can we scale this up to find out how many of the 90 guests we'd expect to like Margaritas?",
        "C": "Because Brett used a random sample it means that the views of the sample should reflect the views of the population. In the sample 4/15 liked Margaritas so we can do 4/15 x 90 to work out that we need to buy 24 Margarita pizzas for the party. Similarly 9/15 x 90 tells us we need 54 Pepperoni pizzas and 2/15 x 90 tells us we need 12 Hawaiian pizzas.",
        "D": "You have seen that Pepperoni was the most popular choice in the sample, but not everyone would be happy with this. Try to think about the proportion of the sample that liked each type and then scale that up for the 90 guests"

        "B": "You've chosen to buy equal numbers of each flavour, but from our sample we can see that some flavours were more popular than others. How could we scale up the fact that 3 out of 20 people in our sample liked Ready Salted best?",
        "C": "You've kept the flavours in the same proportions as the bar chart which is great, but yours add up to 200 crisps in total. Tegan only wants to buy 120 packets. How could you scale up the proportions so they add to 120 exactly?",
        "D": "Because Tegan used a random sample it means that the views of the sample should reflect the views of the population. In the sample 3/20 liked Ready Salted so we can do 3/20 x 120 to work out that we need to buy 18 packets of Ready Salted for the party. Similarly 11/20 x 120 tells us we need 66 packets of Cheese and Onion and 6/20 x 120 tells us we need 36 packets of Barbecue."
