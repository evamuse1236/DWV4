        "A": "The fixed entry fee will be the same in all scenarios and does not get multiplied by anything. What else could the '2' represent?",

        "C": "Looking at the formula the '3' represents a fixed cost and then we are adding '2t' where 't' is the element that varies. This could be anything like time or number of children. But the '2' is what we multiply this by. The only option that fits here is the cost per hour, a specified value that changes depending on 't' (in this case, the hours)",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The '3' is not affected by another value such as an unknown letter. So we know it must represent a fixed charge of some type.",

        "C": "The cost per hour will be a number that is then multiplied by a letter (the number of hours spent inside). In our formula the 3 is not being multiplied by anything so it does not change dependent on the hours. What do we call this?",
