        "C": "Not quite, we would expect to see a curve if the rate of growth increased as the gradient would be getting steeper. What might a straight line represent?",

        "C": "Not quite. This graph is downward sloping, which means the more dollars we exchange the less euros we would get. Is this what happens when you exchange currency?",
        "D": "Converting between dollars and euros is an example of direct proportion. For every dollar you exchange you get the same amount of euros and for $0 you would get €0. Therefore we are looking for a graph that goes through (0,0) and has a constant positive gradient (upward sloping straight line). Therefore, the graph shown in D would be the most likely graph."
