This simplifies to 65 = 2080 ÷ 32 but the right-hand side is still too big. To change 2080 to 208, divide both sides by 10 to give 6.5 = 208 ÷ 32. Also, thinking about an estimated answer for 208 ÷ 32, we could say it’s roughly of the order 200/30 = 20/3 ≈ 6.5, so estimating can be useful in deciding the size of the answer.",

The left-hand side can be written as (32 × 65)/0.32. Treating this as you would a fraction and multiplying numerator and denominator by 100, we could write this as (100 × 32 × 65)/32.
