The number 8 doesn't go into 7, so the answer begins ‘0.’ and the 7 is carried over to give the next calculation of 70 ÷ 8 = 8 remainder 6. There is now ‘0.8’ written above the bus-stop. The 6 is carried over for the next calculation of 60 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 4 (giving ‘0.87’ as an answer so far). The next stage is 40 ÷ 8 = 5, which completes the calculation because there are no remainders. So 7/8 = 0.875"
