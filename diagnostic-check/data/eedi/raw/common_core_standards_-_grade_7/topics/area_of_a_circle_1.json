      "explanations": {
        "A": "Tom is correct; the formula for the area of a circle is 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟². The diameter is twice the length of the radius, so 𝑑 = 2𝑟 and so 𝑟 = 𝑑/2. Substituting 𝑑/2 in place of 𝑟 for 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² gives 𝐴 = 𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑑/2)² = 𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑑²/4), so Katie is incorrect because she hasn't squared the 2 on the denominator.",
        "B": "Not quite. Try using the fact that r = d/2 to help see who has the formula for the area of a circle",

        "A": "Note that 𝑟 = 𝑑/2, so will substituting this into 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² give Paul's formula?",
        "B": "Almost! Look at 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² and try to make r the subject. 'Divide both sides by 𝜋' will be the first step towards this. What's the next step?",
        "C": "For Jo’s formula, work on 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² by dividing both sides by 𝜋 to give 𝐴/𝜋 = 𝑟². Now square root both sides: √(𝐴/𝜋) = 𝑟, so this is correct. Comparing Paul’s 𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑑²/4) with (𝐴) = 𝜋𝑟², we can see that the diameter is used instead of the radius. Let’s see if this is the correct formula: we know that 𝑑 = 2r, and so 𝑟 = 𝑑/2. Substituting this into 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² gives 𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑑/2)² and removing the brackets (so squaring each term within) gives 𝐴 = 𝜋(𝑑²/4), so correct again.",
        "D": "Jo's formula has 𝐴 and r in it, so it may be 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟² rearranged - see if you can! Paul's uses the fact that 𝑟 = 𝑑/2. Have a go at substituting this instead of 𝑟 - see where it gets you!"
