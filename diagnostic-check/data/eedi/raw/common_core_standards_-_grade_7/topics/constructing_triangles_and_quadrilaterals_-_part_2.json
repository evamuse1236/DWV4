        "A": "For Tom’s statement, picture the base length being the longest side (11cm). Could the other two sides be 10cm and 2cm? Yes they could, because in total they are longer than the base side. However this shows us that Katie’s lengths would not form a triangle as 5 ＋ 3 is equal to 8. If the 5 and 3 started from either end of the 8cm line they would only meet if they formed a perfectly straight line. In which case we would have a line, not a triangle.",
        "B": "Not quite. Try drawing some diagrams to help you. What would happen if the 2 shorter sides added to make the same length as the longest side?",
        "C": "Not quite. Try drawing some diagrams to help you. What would happen if the 2 shorter sides added to make the same length as the longest side?",
        "D": "Not quite. Try drawing some diagrams to help you. It does seem strange to have a 2cm length between two much longer sides, but is it impossible?"

        "A": "Not quite. If I know 2 side lengths of a triangle does that mean there is only one option for the third length? Try holding two pens together as the two sides and investigating what happens when you change the angle between them.",

        "D": "Jo’s statement is incorrect: three pieces of information are needed in order to construct a triangle. If only 2 side lengths are given, then the angle between these sides is also necessary in order to define the length of the third side. Paul’s statement is incorrect because a compass can be used to construct a triangle, providing the lengths of all 3 sides have been given."
