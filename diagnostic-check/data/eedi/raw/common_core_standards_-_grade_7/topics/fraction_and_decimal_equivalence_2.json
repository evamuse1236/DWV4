      "explanations": {
        "A": "I would halve the numerator and denominator to get a fraction that is over 100. Half of 9 is 4.5 so we can write this as 4.5/100 which means 4.5 divided by 100 or 0.045",

        "D": "Lets find an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 1000 as that can be easily converted to a decimal. 250 x 4 = 1000 so lets multiply the numerator and denominator by 4. We would get 388/1000. This means 388 divided by 1000 and can be written as 0.388"
