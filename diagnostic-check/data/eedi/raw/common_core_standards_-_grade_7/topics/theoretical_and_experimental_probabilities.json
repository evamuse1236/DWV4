It would be quite unlikely for things to match exactly. The experiment would need to be done a large number of times in order to suggest the theoretical probability was wrong. Which might be a better explanation?",

        "A": "Although every number from 1 to 6 was rolled, their frequencies are very uneven so it wouldn't suggest it was a fair die. We wouldn't expect the frequencies to all be the same in this experiment but they should be close. Take a look at the frequencies, can you choose the correct explanation now?",
        "B": "Although we would expect each number to be rolled about (120/6) 20 times, in an experiment they will usually vary because of random chance. We'd expect them to be close but they don't need to be exact. Can you use this information to choose the answer now?",
        "C": "From the results of the experiment you might say 5 is the least likely number to be rolled, but that doesn't mean it will not be rolled. Think about why 5 has come up considerably less than the others. Are there any other numbers that come up a lot more or less than the others? What does this mean?",
        "D": "The frequencies for 2 and 5 are quite different from the other numbers - they are quite a lot higher or lower than we would expect. We're expecting each frequency to be around 20. This may be strong evidence that the die is not fair and therefore it is biased."
