        "A": "Not quite! A rectangle is only a 2D shape, not a solid which is 3D, so it would not have a cross-section.",
        "B": "Not quite! The uniform cross-section of a cube is a square not a rectangle.",
        "C": "A cross section is the resulting shape obtained by making a slice through an object. A uniform cross section happens when you cut the shape in a particular way and the resulting shape matches the ends. Shape Q must be that of a cuboid because by cutting in one direction, a rectangle would appear all the way through.",
        "D": "Not quite! The rectangle shown is a uniform cross-section of solid Q. A uniform cross section happens when you cut the shape in a particular way and the resulting shape matches the ends. Although you would see a rectangle at some points when you cut into a cylinder in a certain direction, this would not be the same throughout the shape."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Almost! Well done for finding the rectangular cross-section in the rectangular-based pyramid. For the cube and cylinder, think about if you could find a rectangle at a different angle in the shape.",
        "B": "Almost! Well done for correctly identifying the rectangular cross-section from the diagonal of the cube. Have a think about all the different cross-sections for a rectangular-based pyramid and a cylinder.",
        "C": "Almost! Well done for finding the rectangular cross-section in a cylinder. Have a think about the cross-sections in a cube and a rectangular-based pyramid. Try thinking about different angles and diagonals we could use.",
        "D": "A cross section is the resulting shape obtained by making a slice through an object. This question does not specify in which direction the slice should be made, nor that it should be capable of giving a uniform cross-section. This means that all these shapes could produce a rectangle (for Answer A: slicing horizontally, for Answer B: taking a diagonal slice, and for Answer C: taking a vertical slice)."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "A cross section is the resulting shape obtained by making a slice through an object. If a cone is sliced horizontally anywhere along its height, the shape made where the slice occurs will be a circle. As the cone tapers to a point, these circles will become smaller the further up the cone.",
        "B": "A circle is a 2D shape, but we are looking at the cross-section of a solid, which would be a 3D shape.",
        "C": "A triangular-based prism, if you cut a slice out of it at any point, the slice would not be shaped like a circle. Have a think about another solid which has a circular cross-section at one point of the shape.",
        "D": "Think carefully about all the shapes here. We are looking for a solid, which, if you cut a slice out of it at any point or in any direction, it would be circular."

        "A": "A uniform cross-section is when you cut a solid in a way such that the same cross-sectional shape continues throughout the solid. Although a triangular based pyramid has a triangle cross section at certain points, this identical shape does not continue throughout.",
        "B": "A uniform cross-section is when you cut a solid in a way such that the same cross-sectional shape continues throughout the solid. Although a cone would have a triangle cross section at certain points, this identical shape does not continue throughout.",
        "C": "A cross section is the resulting shape obtained by making a slice through an object. A uniform cross-section happens when you cut the shape in a particular way and the resulting shape matches the ends. The word ‘prism’ means the shape has identical ends and a uniform cross-section. Answer C tells us that this shape has a triangle running all the way through it. The other options can produce a triangle when sliced in a particular way, but this triangle will be different along its length.",
        "D": "A uniform cross-section is when you cut a solid in a way such that the same cross-sectional shape continues throughout the solid. Think carefully about which of the shapes here would have the identical triangle running the entire way through them."
