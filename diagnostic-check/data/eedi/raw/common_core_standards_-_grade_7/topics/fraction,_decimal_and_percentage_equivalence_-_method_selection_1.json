        "A": "0.35 means we have 3 tenths (3/10) and 5 hundredths (5/100). To add these together , we convert the 3/10 into hundredths (30/100). So 30/100 + 5/100 = 35/100. This simplifies to 7/20 by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5. So Tom is correct. Katie should have multiplied by 100 to convert from a decimal to a percentage. 0.35 should be 35%. So Katie is not correct.",
