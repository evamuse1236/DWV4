        "B": "I think you saw two headers that say red, so used this as the numerator. It might help to remember each square in the sample space is a possible outcome, and for our probability we are looking for any outcomes that result in a red ball from each bag.",
        "C": "I think you have incorrectly calculated the number of possible outcomes from the sample space. It might help to remember each square in the sample space is a possible outcome, and for our probability we are looking for any outcomes that result in a red ball from each bag..",
