        "A": "The best way to check who is correct in this question is to think of your own method to find ★, and then try that with your calculator, and check whether Tom and Katie's answers are the same or not :) It might help to remember that if we increase an amount by 16%, then we have 100% + 16%, so 116% in total.",

        "C": "Tom’s method recognises that increasing by 16%, means adding 16% to 100% to get 116%. Using a decimal multiplier, ★ x 1.16 = 150. To find ★, we need to do 150 ÷ 1.16. For Katie’s approach, the 150 equates to 116%. This means 116% = 150, and so dividing both sides by 116 gives us 1% = 150/116. Multiplying by 100 gives 100% so ★ = 150/116 × 100. So Tom and Katie are both correct.",
