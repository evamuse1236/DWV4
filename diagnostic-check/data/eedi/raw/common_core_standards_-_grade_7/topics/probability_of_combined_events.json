        "B": "Not quite. There are more than 3 outcomes in this experiment. Can you find them all? If you get a Head on the first coin, what could you get on the second? What if you get a Tail on the first coin, what could you get on the second?",

        "A": "Not quite. To find the probability we need to multiply rather than add. As well this, think about how many cards there would be after you have picked the first card? Would there still be 52?",
        "B": "There are 4 aces, so the probability of getting the first ace is 4/52. As there are now 3 aces and 51 cards, the next probability is 3/51. Multiplying the two together gives the full probability.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite. This is the probability of picking a 5 of hearts OR a 9 of hearts. To find the probability of picking ANY two hearts from a pack of cards you need to first find the probability of picking one heart and multiply it with the probability of picking another heart given the fact you have taken one out already.",

        "C": "So close! How many hearts would be in the pack after you have picked the first one?",
        "D": "As there are 13 hearts, the probability of picking one heart is 13/52. The probability of picking a second heart is 12/51, as we have removed one of the hearts from the pack. We then multiply them together to get the answer."
