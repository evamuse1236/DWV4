      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite! I think you have seen the graph starts on the y-axis at £10 and assumed this was the cost per mile. This £10 is the fixed cost, as it has to be paid even if the customer travels 0 miles. The cost for every additional mile can be found by comparing two distances and their corresponding costs. \n\n",
        "B": "Not quite! The cost for every additional mile can be found by comparing two distances and their corresponding costs. How much does it cost to travel 10 miles? How much does it cost to travel 20 miles? How many additional miles is this? How much does it cost to travel these additional miles? Can you share this between each additional mile?",
        "C": "Be careful! Every large square on the x-axis is 5 miles not 1.",
        "D": "The cost of travelling 10 miles is £20. The cost of travelling 20 miles is £30. To travel these extra 10 miles you are charged £10. To find the additional cost per mile we divide. 10 ÷ 10 = 1.\nTherefore it costs £1 for every additional mile travelled. This is the gradient of the graph."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "The additional cost is the gradient of the graph, we find this by comparing two points on the graph. For 0 minutes used the cost is £20. For 500 minutes used the cost is £35. This is an additional £15 for an extra 500 minutes used. The cost for every additional minute is found by dividing. 15 ÷ 500 = 0.03. Therefore it costs £0.03 for every additional minute.",
        "B": "Not quite! I think you have done the division the wrong way around. 33.33 is the additional number of minutes you get for every £1 spent. We want to calculate the additional cost for every extra minute.",
        "C": "Be careful! I think you have seen that the graph goes across five and therefore divided 35 by 5, but the x-axis is labelled using 100's not 1's.",
        "D": "Not quite! It looks like you have found the fixed cost (the cost the calls start at). To calculate the additional cost we need to find the cost for two different lengths of calls, and then compare the costs and the number of minutes. Then you can find the cost per minute"

        "A": "I think you have the right idea, but how many seconds are in a minute?",
        "B": "It looks like you have read from the time (seconds) axis. Using the line labelled 'Q', we need to read across to the y axis to work out how much water leaks in a certain time (for example, 30 seconds) and then use this to find the rate per 60 seconds",
        "C": "Using the 'Q' line we can see that the amount of water has dropped from 10 litres to 4 litres in 30 seconds. So a rate of 6 litres per 30 seconds, which scaling up gives us 12 litres per minute.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Using the 'P' line we can see that the amount of water has dropped from 14 litres to 0 litres in 40 seconds. Therefore, it is leaking at a rate of 0.35 l per second (14/40). We can multiply this by 60 to get the rate per minute. 0.35 x 60 = 21 litres per minute",
        "B": "I think you might have made a mistake when converting your rate from litres per second to litres per minute. How many seconds are in a minute?",
        "C": "It looks like you have worked out how much water leaks per second, but we want the rate per minute. How can you change your answer to get this?",
        "D": "14 litres leaked out of container P in 40 seconds. That gives us a rate of 14 litres per 40 seconds. How can we scale this up to get a rate per 60 seconds?"
