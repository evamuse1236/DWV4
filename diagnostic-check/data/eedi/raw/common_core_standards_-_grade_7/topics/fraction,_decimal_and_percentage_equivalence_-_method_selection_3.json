        "A": "Looking at Tom’s statement, 45% = 45/100 = 0.45, and since 0.45 > 0.059, this is clearly true. Katie has a tricky fraction in that the denominator is an awkward value; however, noting that 15/31 < 1/2 because 15/30 = 1/2, and also that 15.5/31 = 1/2 (although not in fraction form due to numerator not being a whole number, for the purpose of this question, it is helpful to view it as this rather than 31/62), it follows that 16/31 > 1/2, making Katie’s statement incorrect.",

        "C": "Not quite. Can you compare 20/41 to 50%? Remember to go from a percentage to a decimal we multiply by 100",
        "D": "Looking at Jo’s statement, 52% = 52/100 = 52 ÷ 100 = 0.52, we can see that this percentage is not equal to 0.052. Paul has a tricky fraction in that the denominator is an awkward value; however, 20/41 is less than 1/2. As a result we can conclude that Paul’s statement is also incorrect."
