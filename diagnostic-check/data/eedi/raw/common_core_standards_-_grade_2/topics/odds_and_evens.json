        "A": "I think you may be confusing the counters given out already with the total number of counters. Try imagining that 10 counters have been given out already (an even amount as everyone gets 2 each), would the left over counters make this up to an even or odd number? What if it was another even number of counters that have already been given out?",
        "B": "We are able to work it out without collecting in the counters. Try imagining that 10 counters have been given out already (an even amount as everyone gets 2 each), would the left over counters make this up to an even or odd number? What if it was another even number of counters that have already been given out?",
        "C": "The counters were given out in 2s, so each person is one extra column of counters on the diagram. Not matter how many extra columns we add, there will still be that extra 1 on the end, so it's an odd number of counters.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "You may think it's odd because there are an odd number of blocks in each row. Try thinking about it as columns. Each person got one column of blocks (2 blocks) and we have complete columns of 2 left. What does this tell us?",

        "C": "The blocks were given out in 2s, so each person is one extra column of counters on the diagram. No matter how many extra columns we add, there will be full columns of 2, so it is even.",
