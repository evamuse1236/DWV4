        "A": "612 is the number 'six hundred and twelve'. We have a 6 in the hundreds column to give us 'six hundred'. The 12 is two more than ten so.. eleven, twelve! Therefore, 612 is 'six hundred and twelve.'",
        "B": "Consider the place value columns that each digit is in, and what they are worth. 612 is the same as 600+12.",

        "D": "I think you have misread the number. 621 is 'six hundred and twenty one'... not 612. Think of 612 as 600+12."

        "B": "This number has a 7 in the hundreds column, giving us 'seven hundred', as well as a 2 in the tens column, giving us 'twenty', and a 5 in the units column, giving us 'five'. Therefore 725 is seven hundred and twenty five.",

The sticks are actually 10 tall stacks of cubes, making them worth 10. Therefore, what number is being represented?",
        "C": "The green tiles are worth 100, and the yellow sticks are worth 10. 100 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 240 or two hundred and forty.",
