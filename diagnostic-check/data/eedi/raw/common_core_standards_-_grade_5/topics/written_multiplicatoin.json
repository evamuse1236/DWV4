        "C": "I think you may have done 2 x 6 to find this number, but remember the J is a 0 because we are multiplying by 20 not 2. If J is 0, what do we multiply to get I?",

        "C": "I think you may have thought this because 30 × 80 is 2400 but in long multiplication we do not just multiply the two numbers in the same column and we do not partition the numbers to take account of their place value. The first step is to multiply every digit in the number 437 by the 1.",
        "D": "Each square of the first row contains one of each of the digits from the answer to 437 × 1. Because the answer to this is 437 and ★ is the second digit from the right, the answer is 3."

Write 2 below the 6, carry the 4 to the tens column and then calculate 2 × 6 = 12. Adding the carried 4 gives 16, so ★ = 6 and the 1 is carried to the hundreds column.",

But we need to check any previous steps and continue with the calculation. Write out your workings in full and see if you can spot what else we need to include here.",
        "C": "4 x 2 does give us 8, but we need to check whether any of the previous calculations (4 x 6 or 4 x 7) would have meant any numbers were carried over into this column. Start from the right and write your full method down.",
        "D": "We start by working out 4 x 6. This gives us 24 so the 4 stays in the ones column and the 2 moves into the tens. Then we work out 4 x 7 which gives us 28. We need to add the 2 which was carried over from before so we now have 30. The 0 stays in the tens column and we carry the 3 into the hundreds column. Finally we work out 4 x 2 which gives us 8. We need to add the 3 which was carried over. This now gives us 11. So we have 1 in our hundreds column and 1 in our thousands column."

Start from the right and write your full method down.",
        "B": "We start by working out 6 x 1 which gives us 6 so we put the 6 in the ones column and nothing carries over. We can now work out 6 x 8 which gives us 48. The 8 stays in the tens column and we carry the 4 over to the hundreds column. Finally we work out 6 x 3. This gives us 18, but we need to add on the 4 that we carried over. We get 22 so 2 stays in the hundreds column and 2 moves into the thousands.",
        "C": "I think you might have multiplied 3 x 3 here. Remember we need to start from the right hand side. Start by working out 6 x 1, working from right to left and write your full method down.",
