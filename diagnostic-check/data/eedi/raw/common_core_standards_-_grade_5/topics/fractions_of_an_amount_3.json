        "D": "There are various ways of looking at this problem. One would be to note that for the left-hand diagram, there are 3 shaded columns with a total area of 3 square metres. This means that 1 column = 1 square metre, and so, looking at the right-hand diagram, the column with 2 squares shaded has an area of 0.5 square metres. Adding the other completely shaded columns gives a total area of 2½ square metres. Another way, performing a direct calculation would be 10/12 of 3 = 5/6 ✕ 3/1 = 15/6 = 2½."

This means that 1 column = 1 square metre, and so, looking at the right-hand diagram, we have 2 completely shaded columns, contributing 2 square metres, and 2 other columns, each with an area of 1/3 square metres. Adding this together gives a total area of 2＋1/3 ＋1/3 = 2 and 2/3 square metres. Another way, performing a direct calculation would be 8/12 of 4 = 8/12 ✕ 4/1 = 32/12 = 2 and 8/12 = 2 and 2/3 square metres.",

        "B": "Initially, there are 3 bars to share amongst 7 people, so each received 3 ÷ 7 = 3/7ths of a bar. When new people arrive, the situation changes to 4 bars to share amongst 10 friends, so each received 4 ÷ 10 = 4/10ths of a bar. Comparing these amounts is easier if the denominators are the same: 3/7 = 30/70 and 4/10 = 28/70. Because 30 is bigger than 28, 30/70 or 3/7 is the larger fraction, meaning the amount of chocolate decreased.",

When new people arrive, the situation changes to £7.50 to share amongst 10 friends, so each received 7.5 ÷ 10 = 7.5/10ths of £1. Comparing these amounts is easier if the denominators are the same: 3/4 = 30/40 and 7.5/10 = 15/20 = 30/40. Both numerators and denominators are the same, meaning the amount of money the 8 friends receive remains the same.",

Another way of looking at this problem is to consider that 'of' is the same as × in maths, so the calculation can be written as ⅓ × 8/1 = 8/3. Either method is acceptable.",

Another way of looking at this problem, which is perhaps easier when values become more complicated, is to consider that 'of' is the same as × in maths, so the calculation can be written as ⅓ × ⅓ , then you multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
