        "A": "It looks like you have correctly identified that 'of' means you need to do a calculation with the two fractions, but you have divided instead of multiplying. Also, check your method for dividing fractions, as there seems to be a mistake in the calculation.",
        "B": "The word 'of' in this type of problem means you need to multiply the fractions together, not divide them.",
        "C": "To find a fraction 'of' an amount, you need to multiply. In this case, to find 1/2 of 5/8, you multiply 5/8 by 1/2.",
        "D": "You have correctly identified that you need to multiply the two fractions. However, when multiplying fractions, you do not need to find a common denominator. You can simply multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denominators together."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The question asks for half 'of' the leftovers. In maths, 'of' usually means multiply. To find the answer, you need to calculate 3/8 multiplied by 1/2. To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.",
        "B": "It looks like you tried to find a common denominator before multiplying. Remember, you only need to do that when adding or subtracting fractions. For multiplying, you can just multiply the top numbers and then the bottom numbers.",
        "C": "The question asks you to find a fraction 'of' another fraction, which means you should multiply. It appears you have divided instead. You should also check your method for dividing fractions.",
        "D": "The word 'of' in the question is a clue that you need to multiply the fractions. It looks like you have divided them instead. Have another look at the calculation."

        "A": "To find the total amount of flour, you need to multiply the amount per person (1/4) by the number of people (5 1/2). The best way to do this is to convert 5 1/2 to an improper fraction first. 5 and 1/2 is 11/2, so the calculation is 1/4 x 11/2 = 11/8 which converts to 1 and 3/8 as a mixed number.",

        "C": "This question asks for 1/4 of a cup for each of the 5 1/2 people. This is a repeated amount, which means you should multiply, not add.",
        "D": "You have chosen to divide. This would tell you how many people you could make a cake for with 5 1/2 cups of flour. The question asks for the total amount of flour needed, so you should multiply."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "When multiplying a mixed number by a fraction, it's best to change the mixed number into an improper fraction first. It looks like you may have only multiplied the fraction parts and left the whole number part as it was.",
        "B": "To find the total amount of sugar, you need to multiply the amount per person (1/5) by the number of people (6 and 1/2). To multiply mixed numbers, it's easiest to convert them to improper fractions first. 6 and 1/2 is 13/2, so the calculation is 1/5 x 13/2 = 13/10. Converting to a mixed number gives 1 and 3/10.",
        "C": "The problem asks for the total sugar needed if the recipe is scaled up for 6 and a half people. This means you need to multiply the amount per person by the number of people. It seems you may have divided instead of multiplied.",
        "D": "This question asks for 1/5 of a cup for each of the 6 1/2 people. This is a repeated amount, which means you should multiply, not add."

        "A": "The sprinter has run 2/3 'of' the total distance (5/7 of a mile). The word 'of' tells us to multiply. To calculate this, you multiply the numerators (5 x 2) and then the denominators (7 x 3).",

        "D": "The question is asking for 3/5 'of' 3 1/2 cups. To find a fraction of an amount, you need to multiply. To do this, it's easiest to convert the mixed number, 3 1/2, into an improper fraction first. 3 1/2 = 7/2 so the calculation is 7/2 × 3/5 = 21/10. As a mixed number this is 2 and 1/10."
