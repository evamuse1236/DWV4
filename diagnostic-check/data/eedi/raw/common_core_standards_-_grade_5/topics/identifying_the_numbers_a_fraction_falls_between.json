        "A": "Not all fractions need to be less than 1. 3/2 means we have three halves. Can you count along the number line in halves to see which letter you get to?",

        "C": "The fraction has 2 and 3 in it but that doesn't mean the letter between 2 and 3 represents it. 3/2 means 3 x 1/2. Can you count along the number line in halves until you get to 3/2?",
