        "A": "The final stage of this long multiplication is the addition of the numbers 116 (found from 2 x 58) and 1160 (found from 20 x 58). Adding these together gives us an answer of 1276 which has a unit digit of 6.",
        "B": "I think you may have thought this because when we multiply by the '20' we put a 0 in the units column. However when we multiply by the '2' we will get another number which will contribute to the units column.",
        "C": "Be careful, I think you have added the 8 and the 2 together to get 10, but we are multiplying here",
        "D": "Not quite, 16 is a two digit number there will only be one number in the units column of the final answer."

        "A": "The final stage of this long multiplication is the addition of the numbers 210 (found from 6 x 35) and 1400 (found from 40 x 35). Adding these together gives us an answer of 1610 which has a unit digit of 0.",
        "B": "Be careful, I think you have added the 5 and the 6 together to get 11, but we are multiplying here",
        "C": "I think you may have thought this because one of the 4 calculations you have to do in this long multiplication is 6 x 3, which ends in an 8. But this calculation does not contribute to the units digit of the answer. Which of the 4 multipications will contribute to the units digit of your answer?",

        "C": "Each square of the first row contains the answer to the calculation 127 × 6. To work this out, start with 7 × 6 = 42. Write 2 below the 6, carry the 4 to the tens column and then calculate 2 × 6 = 12. Adding the carried 4 gives 16, so ★ = 6 and the 1 is carried to the hundreds column.",
