        "A": "An equilateral triangle would have three equal sides but this is an isosceles triangle. How can we use the perimeter of 1/2 to help us find the missing side?",
        "B": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of the same length, so we have 1/5 ＋ 1/5 ＋ x = 1/2, and so 2/5 ＋ x = 1/2. If we now take 2/5 away from both sides, this gives us x = 1/2 − 2/5. To subtract these fractions, we need to find equivalent fractions with the same denominator. The lowest common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10, and so we can write 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. The calculation can now be written as x = 5/10 − 4/10 = 1/10.",
