        "A": "Because the 12 − 8 is all multiplied by 3, brackets are necessary around it to ensure this happens. The answer to this has 2 added on to it: (12 − 8) ✕ 3 ＋ 2. Because addition does not take priority over brackets or multiplication, it will be done last anyway, so no brackets required.",
        "B": "You may have written it out in the order it is described without including the necessary brackets. Brackets are needed to ensure the calculations are carried out in the right order.",
        "C": "Almost. Remember calculations in brackets must be carried out before anything else so here you are suggesting the addition needs to be done before the multiplication.",
        "D": "Remember your order of operations. Brackets mean you should carry out that calculation first. Check the order in the question."

        "C": "Because the 22 ＋ 8 is all divided by 3, brackets are necessary around it to ensure this happens. The answer to this has 5 added on to it: (22 ＋ 8) ÷ 3 ＋ 5.
