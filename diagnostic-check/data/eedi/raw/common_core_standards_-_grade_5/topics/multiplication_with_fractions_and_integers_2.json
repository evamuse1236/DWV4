When multiplying fractions, find the product of the numerator and denominator separately: (1 ✕ 9)/(5 ✕ 1) = 9/5. This can be written as a mixed number because 5 goes into 9 once with 4 remaining. We write it as 1 and 4/5",

When multiplying fractions, find the product of the numerator and denominator separately: (1 ✕ 15)/(7 ✕ 1) = 15/7, which is Paul’s answer. Also, this can be written as a mixed number because 7 goes into 15 twice with 1 remaining. We write it as 2 and 1/7, so Jo is also correct.",
