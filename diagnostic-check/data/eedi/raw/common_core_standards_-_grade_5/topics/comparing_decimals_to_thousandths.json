        "A": "Be careful. When comparing decimals, compare the ones in the same place value column. Remember 0.2 is the same as 0.20.",
        "B": "Remember, the inequality sign always ‘points’ to the smaller value. Tom’s numbers are 0.15 (so 1 tenth and 5 hundredths) and 0.2 (with 2 tenths). His inequality sign is pointing the wrong way because 1 tenth is less than 2 tenths, and the 5 hundredths contributes very little by comparison to tenths. Katie is correct because 0.020 has only 2 hundredths.",
        "C": "Not quite. When comparing decimals remember to compare the digits with the same place value.",
