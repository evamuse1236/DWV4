        "A": "3 tenths multiplied by 10 would give us 30/10 which is simplified to 3. We also know that when multiplying by 10, all of the digits move to the left, so the 3 digit would move from the tenths column into the units column.",
        "B": "I think you have multiplied by 100 rather than 10. How many place value columns would multiplying by 10 move the digits?",
        "C": "I think you have assumed that when we multiply by 10 we just add a zero onto the number, which is not the case. When multiplying by a power of 10, we move the digits to the left. How many place value columns would multiplying by 10 move the digits?",
        "D": "I think you have tried to combine the digits. When multiplying by a power of 10, we move the digits to the left. How many place value columns would multiplying by 10 move the digits?"
