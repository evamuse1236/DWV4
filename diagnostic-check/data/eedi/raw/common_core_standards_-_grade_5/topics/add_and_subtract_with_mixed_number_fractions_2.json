        "B": "I think you've worked out the total number of fifths in the first fraction. Now you need to add up how many fifths you have altogether, and then simplify.",
        "C": "As there are five fifths in every whole, and therefore ten fifths in two wholes, we can rewrite this calculation as 10/5 + 3/5 + 2/5. This gives us a total of 15/5, which equals 3.",
        "D": "I think you've done 23/5 + 2/5, but 2 and 3/5 is not the same as 23/5. The 2 in the mixed number means 2 wholes. How many fifths in two wholes? How many fifths do you have in total? Can you write this as a whole number?"
