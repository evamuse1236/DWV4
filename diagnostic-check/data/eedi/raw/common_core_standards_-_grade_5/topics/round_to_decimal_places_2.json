        "A": "Not quite, I think you had the correct method but forgot to carry. Have a think about where 0.9999 and 0.10 would be on a number line to understand where this may have gone wrong.",

        "C": "Nearly! Remember to check whether the number in the thousandths column is 5 or above, and if it will affect the number before it.",
        "D": "This answer is correct :) There are 9 thousandths, and so because 9 is 5 or above, we have to round the 9 hundredth up to 10 hundredths, which is 1 tenth. That extra tenth then adds to the 9 tenths already there, giving us 10 tenths, which is 1 unit. This extra unit carries over to the 0 units and gives us an answer of 1.00. Notice that it is important to have two digits after the decimal point to show we've rounded to 2dp."

That extra tenth then adds to the 9 tenths already there, giving us 10 tenths, which is 1 unit. This extra unit carries over to the 0 units and gives us an overall answer of 11.00.

        "A": "This answer is correct :) When rounding to three decimal places, you look to the fourth digit after the point (the 10 thousandths column), and if that number is a 5 or above then the digit in the thousandths column increases by 1, if not then the thousandths column stays the same. Here, 4 is less than 5, and so the 3 thousandths stay as they are. Giving an answer 20.153",

        "C": "Remember to check whether the 4th digit after the point is a 5 or above, and use this to decide if the thousandths column will be affected.",

Here, 8 is more than 5, and so the 6 thousandths increase by 1 to become 7 thousandths. Everything else stays the same, giving an answer 29.157."
