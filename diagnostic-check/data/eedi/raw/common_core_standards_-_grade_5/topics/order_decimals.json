Looking at Katie's and working from left to right, they have the same units but 5.1 has more tenths than 5.01 so it must be larger. Therefore only Katie is correct.",

Looking at Paul's and working from left to right, they have the same units and tenths but 3.04 has more hundredths than 3.014 so it must be larger rather than smaller.

For Tom's numbers, we can cover up the zero and the point at the start because they are the same in both. The first digit after the decimal point is different in each number and 4 is greater than 1 so 0.42 must be greater than 0.15: we write this as 0.42 > 0.15. For Katie's numbers, we know that 2 is less than 4 so 2.51 must be less than 4.31: we write this as 2.51 < 4.31.

Starting from the left in the ones column, 2.022 is the largest because it is the only number that has a 2 instead of a zero in the ones column. Next we check the tenths column after the decimal point: 0.202 and 0.220 both have two tenths but 0.022 has no tenths, so 0.022 must be the smallest number. Finally we check the hundredths column to compare 0.202 and 0.220: 0.202 has no hundredths but 0.220 has two hundredths so 0.202 is smaller.
