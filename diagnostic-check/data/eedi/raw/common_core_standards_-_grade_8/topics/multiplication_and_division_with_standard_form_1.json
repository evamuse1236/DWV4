        "A": "I think you subtracted 1 from the power as the 30 has been divided by 10. However these two sides are equal, so if the 30 is divided by 10 how could we balance this out?",
        "B": "If you multiply 30 by 10 5 times, you don't get the same as multiplying 3 by 10 5 times. How many times would you need to multiply 3 by 10 to get the same?",
        "C": "Comparing the numbers, we can see that there is 30 on the left-hand side and 3 on the right-hand side. Noting that 30 = 3 × 10¹, we can substitute this in to the left-hand side to give 3 × 10¹ × 10⁵. We have two powers of 10 which are multiplied, meaning we can add the powers to give 3 × 10⁶. This now looks like the right-hand side, and so ★ = 6",
