        "D": "Neither Jo nor Paul is correct. Jo divided both sides of the equation by 6 but forgot to divide the 4 by 6. Paul subtracted four from the left hand side of the equation but added four to the right. When transforming equations the same must be done to both sides."

To undo these steps, we do the inverse operations in the reverse order: so the best first step is to divide by 4.

        "A": "Jo is correct because she has divided both sides of the equation by 6. Despite subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation Paul is incorrect as he failed to consider the 6 outside of the bracket. Expanding the bracket we get 6m + 24 = 24, subtracting four from both sides we get 6m + 20 = 20, which is different from Paul's expression..",

        "C": "Did Paul multiply by 6 or divide by 6 as his first step? And it looks like Jo may have tried to add 4. But did they both choose their first steps correctly?",
        "D": "Both Jo and Paul are incorrect. Jo has subtracted 4 from both sides failing to recognise that the 6 is dividing the 4 as well. Paul is incorrect as he has multiplied the left hand side by 6 but divided the right hand side by 6. When transforming equations we must perform the same calculation to both sides of the equation."
