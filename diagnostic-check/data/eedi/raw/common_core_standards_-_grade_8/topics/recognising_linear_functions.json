        "C": "Both graphs are straight lines meaning that they are linear, and both have positive slopes. Therefore, Tom and Katie are both correct.",
        "D": "At least one of them is correct. I think you may have mixed up positive and negative slopes, and assumed that linear must mean horizontal or vertical. Linear means that it is a straight line, going across and up/ down by the same amount each time. Is this true of either graph? A positive slope would go ‘up’ more the further right it goes. Is this true of either graph too?"

For the first function, when x=0, y=-4, therefore it would cross the y-axis at (0, -4). For the second function, when x=0, y=-4, therefore it would also cross the y-axis at (0, -4).
