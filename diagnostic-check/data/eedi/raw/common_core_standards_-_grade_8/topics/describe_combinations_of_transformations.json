If Shape 2 has rotated one quarter turn from Shape 1, then rotating 270° (three more quarter turns) in the same direction will take it back round to the beginning, so Katie is also correct.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The line 𝑥 = 3, is a vertical line going through 3 on the 𝑥 axis. If we reflect shape P in this line, it will flip horizontally and so shape R would be in exactly the same position as shape P. This is not where shape R is.",
        "B": "Enlarging by scale factor 2 from centre (0,2) gives shape Q with corners at (4,4), (6,10), (8,4) and (6,2). Enlarging this shape by scale factor -0.5 from (4,8) gives shape R with corners at (2,10), (3,11), (4,10) and (3,7), which is the same as rotating P 180 degrees around (3, 6.5).",
        "C": "If you did this transformation, then shape R would end up the correct size and orientation. However,it would not be in the correct position: point (3,6) would still be at (3,6) when enlarging from point (3,6), which isn't the case for shape R.",
        "D": "A translation will keep a shape in the same orientation (the same way up). But shape R is upside down, when compared with shape P, due to one of the enlargements having a negative scale factor."

        "C": "This transformation is equivalent to option B, but neither of these is correct... Double check your centres of rotation, and how far you turned the shape each time. The shape was rotated 90° clockwise, reflected horizontally and rotated 90° clockwise again, it should have ended up with the same orientation (the same way up) as it started.",
        "D": "The first rotation gives shape Q with corners at (3,6), (4,7), (6,6) and (4,5). Reflecting that in the vertical line x=7 gives R with corners at (8,6), (10,7), (11,6) and (10,5). Finally, rotating R gives S with corners at (3,4), (4,6), (5,4) and (4,3). Each of these points is one right and one up from the corresponding corner of P, so the single transformation is a translation."

Finally, rotating Y gives Z with corners at (8,3), (9,5), (10,3) and (9,2).
