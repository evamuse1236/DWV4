        "A": "A similar shape is one with the same angles, however the lengths can be enlarged, and a congruent shape has the same angles and lengths. Both shapes here are squares with angles of 90⁰, but the side length of orange is 2, and green is larger (2.8 using Pythagoras' theorem). This means they are similar but not congruent, so only Tom is correct.",
        "B": "Check your definitions of similar and congruent again. A similar shape has the same angles with sides that have all been enlarged by the same scale factor, and a congruent shape has the same angles and lengths. Hint: you could try measuring the side lengths using a ruler! :)",
