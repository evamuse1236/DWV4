        "A": "Not quite. I think you have forgotten that our equations must always remain balanced. If we add 2x to the left hand side we must also add 2x to the right hand side of the equation. We want to keep x and y only on the left hand side side of the equation. Think about multiplying an equation by a number instead of adding.",
