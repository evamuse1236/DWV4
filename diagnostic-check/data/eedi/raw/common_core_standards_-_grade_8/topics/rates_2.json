        "A": "You've recognised that 1 kg = 1000 g and 1 hour = 60 minutes, but kg/hour is calculated by dividing kilograms by time. What effect will dividing by time have when you convert to g/min?",
        "B": "Let's consider a value of 1 kg/hr. This tells us that in 1 hour, there is 1 kg; so we can write 1 hour = 1 kg. 1 kg = 1000g, so this means we have 1 hour = 1000g, which we have found by multiplying by 1000. We also know that 1 hour = 60 minutes, so we have 60 minutes = 1000g, to find 1 minute, we can divide by 60. This means our overall conversion calculation is to multiply by 1000, then divide by 60.",

This tells us that in 1 minute, there is 1g; so we can write 1 min = 1g. 1000g = 1kg, so this means we have to divide by 1000 to change to kg: 1 min = 0.001kg. We also know that 1 hour = 60 minutes, so to convert to 1 hour, we multiply by 60: 60 mins = 0.001x60 kg= 0.06kg.
