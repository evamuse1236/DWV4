        "B": "x is the side length of the red square. We are told the area of this square is 100 cm². To find the side length, we need to square root the area. √100 = 10, therefore x = 10. y is the area of the yellow square. The area can be found by squaring the side length. 8² = 64, so y = 64.",
        "C": "Not quite. I think you saw the 6 in the diagram and thought you had to use this. But look carefully at the labels. y is the area of the yellow square and x is the side length of the red square. If a square has a side length of 8, what is its area? If a square has an area of 100, what is its side length?",
        "D": "Almost! I think you thought y was the side length of the yellow square, but y is the area. How do we find the area of a square, that has a side length of 8 cm?"

        "B": "Not quite. I think you doubled rather than squared. y is the area of the blue square. To find the area of a square, we need to square the side length, and squaring means multiplying by itself.",

        "D": "x is the side length of the red square. We are told the area of this square is 25 cm². To find the side length, we need to square root the area. √25 = 5, therefore x = 5. y is the area of the blue square. The area can be found by squaring the side length. 3² = 9, so y = 9."
