A scalene triangle can have a right angle, but so too can an isosceles if the other angles are both 45°."

        "D": "At least one of them is correct. Remember angles in a triangle add up to 180, scalene means all the angles are different, and isosceles means two angles are equal. Try out some different angle combinations to see who is correct."
