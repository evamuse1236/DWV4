Substituting this into the top line, we now have 16³/16⁴ or 16³ ÷ 16⁴. We have the same base number and the function is division; therefore, powers must be subtracted: 16⁽³⁻⁴⁾ = 16⁻¹ = 1/16. Perhaps the last part of this is easier to understand if the calculation is written in longhand: 16³/16⁴ = (16 × 16 × 16)/(16 × 16 × 16 × 16).
