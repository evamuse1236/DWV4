        "A": "Standard form a useful way of writing very big or very small numbers. The conditions are that the number is written in two parts. The first part involves using the digits in a way that the value is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10, and the second part which is × 10 to a power. Both these conditions are met, and this is in standard form.",

The first part involves using the digits in a way that the value is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10, and the second part which is × 10 to a power. 10 means 10 to the power of 1, so both these conditions are met, and this is in standard form.",

The first part involves using the digits in a way that the value is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10, and the second part which is × 10 to a power. Looking at the values in D, the issue is that the value of the first part for answer D does not fit this rule because 15.1> 10. Therefore, this is not in standard form."
