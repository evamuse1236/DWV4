        "A": "Not quite. For a number to be in standard form we need a number between 1 and 10 (not including 10), then we multiply by a power of 10.",
        "B": "For standard form the first number needs to be greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10. We then need × 10 to a power. Looking at Tom’s number, the first part of the number does not fit this rule because 0.6 < 1. Therefore, this is not in standard form. Katie’s answer fits the rules because 1 ≤ 7.82567 < 10 and the second part is 10 to a power.",

Jo's answer fits the rules because 1 is between 1 and 10, and the second part is 10 to an integer power. Paul is incorrect because the power of 10 is not an integer",

        "A": "Not quite, remember with standard form it is the power of 10 that tells us about the place values of the digits. Use this to help order the numbers. The bigger the power the bigger the number.",
        "B": "With standard form, remember to look at the number as a whole, not just the first part. For Tom’s numbers, 2.3 × 10⁶ is to a higher power of 10 than 9.3 × 10⁵, which means it has a higher value. For Katie’s values, again considering the whole number, 9.3 × 10⁻⁵ is the bigger value because the power, −5 is greater than −6 for the other number.",

        "A": "With standard form, remember to look at the number as a whole, not just the first part. For Jo’s numbers, 1.106 × 10⁻⁶ is to a higher power of 10 than 1.6 × 10⁻⁷ because −6 > −7 , which means 1.106 × 10⁻⁶ has a higher value. For Paul’s values, the powers this time are the same, so it is reasonable to compare the initial part and note that 1.6 > 1.106, which means that he has the inequality sign pointing the wrong way.",
        "B": "Not quite, remember with standard form it is the power of 10 that tells us about the place values of the digits. Use this to help order the numbers. If the power of 10 is the same, we then need to order based on the first part of the standard form number",
