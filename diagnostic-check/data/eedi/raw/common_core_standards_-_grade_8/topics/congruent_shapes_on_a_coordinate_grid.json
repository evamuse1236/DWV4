        "A": "I think you've used 8 as the y-coordinate because it's the x-coordinate of the bottom right corner. We have to do a calculation to find the y-coordinate, which involves finding the bottom length first.",
        "B": "(8,4) is the coordinate of the bottom right corner which is already labelled. To find the top corner's coordinate, you'll need to do some calculations. Remember to use the fact that an isosceles triangle has two lengths that are equal.",

        "D": "The top vertex is directly above the bottom left so the x-coordinate is the same, 3. The bottom length is 8-3=5. As this is an isosceles triangle, the left side must be 5 long as well. We add 5 to the y-coordinate of the bottom left vertex to get 5+4=9 for the y-coordinate. Giving the coordinates (3,9)."

To get from (9,2) to (11,1), we move 2 right and 1 down, so we need to move 2 right and 1 down from (11,6), giving coordinates (13,5).",

The height of orange is 3, and green is 4, giving a scale factor between these sides of 1.33...
