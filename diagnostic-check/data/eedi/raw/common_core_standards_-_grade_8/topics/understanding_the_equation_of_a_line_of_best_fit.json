        "B": "Looking a the labels on our 𝑥 and 𝑦 axes we see that 𝑥 represents the age in years and 𝑦 represents the height in metres. That means the gradient 0.05, which can be written as 0.05/1 represents the rate of growth: 0.05 metres grown every year.",
        "C": "Close! I think you may have mixed up the gradient with the 𝑦-intercept. Remember, the equation of a straight line is 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑐, where 𝑚 is the gradient and 𝑐 is the 𝑦-intercept.",
        "D": "It looks like you may have gotten mixed up with the variables when looking at the gradient. Remember that the ratio of the gradient is always 𝑦/𝑥, not 𝑥/𝑦."
