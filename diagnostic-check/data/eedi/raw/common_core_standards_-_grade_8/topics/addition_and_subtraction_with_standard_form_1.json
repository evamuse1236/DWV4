        "A": "The power that 10 is raised to is the same in both cases, namely 3. This means that the 4 of 4.7 and the 3 of 3.2 have the same place value, and so the first parts of the standard form numbers can be added to give an answer of 7.9. The power remains the same. This can be easier to see if the numbers are not written in standard form: 4,700 + 3,200 = 7,900 = 7.9 × 10³. It is not essential to write these values as normal numbers, but it helps to see why the power does not change. Another helpful way of seeing things is to note that both terms contain 10³, and so factorising gives 10³ × (4.7 + 3.2) = 10³ × 7.9",
        "B": "Almost, just be careful with your power, we only add the powers when we multiply with the same base, not when we're adding terms.",
        "C": "Not quite, just be careful with your base. 10³ = 1000 which means the values are in the thousands and our first value is 4700. You may find it easier to convert the second number, add them together and then convert the answer back to standard form.",
        "D": "Not quite, we only add the powers when we multiply with the same base, not when we're adding terms. Also, the base is incorrect. You may find it easier to convert to ordinary numbers, add those numbers together and then convert your answer back to standard form."

        "C": "The power that 10 is raised to is the same in both cases, namely 5. This means that the 5 of 5.1 and the 2 of 2.6 have the same place value, and so the first parts of the standard form numbers can be added to give 5.7. The power remains the same. Converting the numbers to ordinary numbers may make this clearer: 510,000 + 260,000 = 770,000 = 7.7 × 10^5. It is not essential to write these values as normal numbers, but it helps to see why the power does not change. Another helpful way of seeing things is to note that both terms contain 10^5, and so factorising gives 10^5 × (5.1 + 2.6) = 10^5 × 7.7",
