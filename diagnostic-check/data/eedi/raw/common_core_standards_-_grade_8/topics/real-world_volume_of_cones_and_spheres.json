        "A": "The formula for the volume of a cone uses the radius (𝑟), not the diameter. The question gives the radius as 6 inches. It looks like you may have used the diameter, which would be 12 inches.",
        "B": "It looks like you have used the formula for the volume of a cylinder (π × 𝑟² × ℎ). Remember that the formula for a cone's volume is (1/3) × π × 𝑟² × ℎ, so you need to divide your answer by 3.",
        "C": "Check the formula for the volume of a cone again. It includes radius squared (𝑟²). It looks like you may have doubled the radius instead of squaring it. Remember 6 squared is 6 × 6.",

        "A": "The formula for the volume of a cone includes 𝑟² (radius squared). It looks like you might have doubled the radius (multiplied by 2) instead of squaring it (multiplying it by itself).",
        "B": "The formula for the volume of a cone is 𝑉 = (1/3) × π × 𝑟² × ℎ. Here, 𝑟 = 5 and ℎ = 36. So, 𝑉 = (1/3) × π × 5² × 36 = (1/3) × π × 25 × 36, which equals 300π.",
        "C": "The formula uses the radius, which is 5 inches. It looks like you may have used the diameter (10 inches) in your calculation instead. Remember the radius is the distance from the centre to the edge of the circle.",
        "D": "You seem to have used the formula for the volume of a cylinder (π × 𝑟² × ℎ). The formula for a cone is similar, but you must also multiply by 1/3 (which is the same as dividing by 3)."

        "A": "The formula for the volume of a cone uses the radius, but the question gives you the diameter (8 cm). Remember to halve the diameter to find the radius before you put it into the formula.",
        "B": "First, find the volume of the cone. The radius is half the diameter, so 𝑟 = 4 cm. Volume = (1/3) × π × 4² × 12, which is approx 201 cm³. Then divide the volume by the rate: 201 / 8 = 25.13 seconds, which rounds to 25 s.",

        "A": "First, find the volume of the cone. The radius is half the diameter, so 𝑟 = 6 cm. The volume is (1/3) × π × 6² × 15 = 180π cm³. To find the time, divide the volume by the rate: (180π) / 10 ≈ 56.5 seconds, which rounds to 57 seconds.",

        "D": "Check the formula for the volume of a sphere again. The radius should be cubed (𝑟³), not squared (𝑟²). Volume is a 3D measure, which is a good clue that you need to use 'cubed'."

        "B": "Your calculation of the number is correct, but remember that both volumes are 'in terms of π'. When you subtract them, the answer should also be in terms of π. It looks like you have forgotten to include π in your final answer.",
        "C": "The radius of the beachball is 6 times larger than the tennis ball. However, this means the volume is 6³ (or 216) times larger. It looks like you might have assumed the volume was only 6 times larger. It's safer to work out each volume separately and then subtract.",

        "C": "It seems you may have worked with 288 instead of 288π. In the equation 288π = (4/3) × π × 𝑟³, you can divide both sides by π first, which makes the calculation simpler.",

        "A": "When you set up the equation, you have pi on both sides: 4500π = (4/3) × π × 𝑟³. You should cancel the π on both sides before you start rearranging. It looks like you might have divided 4500 by π in your calculation.",

        "D": "Set the volume formula equal to the given volume: 4500π = (4/3) × π × 𝑟³. First, divide both sides by π to get 4500 = (4/3) × 𝑟³. Rearrange to find 𝑟³ = 3375. The cube root of 3375 is 15, so the radius is 15 in. The diameter is double the radius, which is 30 in."
