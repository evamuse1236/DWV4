        "B": "Not quite. A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction. 1/Pi cannot be written as a correct fraction because in decimal form the digits of pi do not repeat or terminate.",
        "C": "Not quite. A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction. We can write decimal numbers as fractions if there digits repeat or terminate. Do the digits of pi repeat or terminate? What about 1/pi?",
        "D": "Neither pi nor 1/pi are rational numbers as they cannot be correctly written as fractions when in decimal form. Pi (3.14159...) cannot be converted to a fraction as it has an infinite number of non-repeating digits after the decimal point. The same is true for 1/pi (0.31830...)."
