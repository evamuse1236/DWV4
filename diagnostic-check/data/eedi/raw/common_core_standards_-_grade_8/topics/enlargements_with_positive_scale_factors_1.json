        "C": "The scale factor is 3 so we need a point that is three times as far from the centre of enlargement at the origin (0,0) as the original point (2,1). To get from (0,0) to (2,1), we move 2 across and 1 up. To get from (0,0) to the new point on the enlarged shape, we need to move 3 x 2 = 6 across and 3 x 1 = 3 up. So the red vertex is enlarged to (6,3), point C.",

        "A": "I think you may have counted the squares in the wrong directions. To get from the centre of enlargement at the origin (0,0) to the red vertex, we go 4 squares across and 2 squares up. We need to make sure we do the same again to double the distance from the centre of enlargement.",

To get from (0,0) to (4,2), we move 4 across and 2 up. To get from (0,0) to the new point on the enlarged shape, we need to move 2 x 4 = 8 across and 2 x 2 = 4 up.

Remember that all the vertices on the enlarged shape will be 1.5 times further away from the centre of enlargement at (0,0) than before. It might help to enlarge the whole shape first and then identify the position of the green vertex."
