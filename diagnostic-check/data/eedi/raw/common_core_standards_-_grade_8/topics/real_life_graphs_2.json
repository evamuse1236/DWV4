      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite! I think you have seen the graph starts on the y-axis at £10 and assumed this was the cost per mile. This £10 is the fixed cost, as it has to be paid even if the customer travels 0 miles. The cost for every additional mile can be found by comparing two distances and their corresponding costs. \n\n",
        "B": "Not quite! The cost for every additional mile can be found by comparing two distances and their corresponding costs. How much does it cost to travel 10 miles? How much does it cost to travel 20 miles? How many additional miles is this? How much does it cost to travel these additional miles? Can you share this between each additional mile?",

        "D": "The cost of travelling 10 miles is £20. The cost of travelling 20 miles is £30. To travel these extra 10 miles you are charged £10. To find the additional cost per mile we divide. 10 ÷ 10 = 1.\nTherefore it costs £1 for every additional mile travelled. This is the gradient of the graph."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "The additional cost is the gradient of the graph, we find this by comparing two points on the graph. For 0 minutes used the cost is £20. For 500 minutes used the cost is £35. This is an additional £15 for an extra 500 minutes used. The cost for every additional minute is found by dividing. 15 ÷ 500 = 0.03. Therefore it costs £0.03 for every additional minute.",
        "B": "Not quite! I think you have done the division the wrong way around. 33.33 is the additional number of minutes you get for every £1 spent. We want to calculate the additional cost for every extra minute.",
        "C": "Be careful! I think you have seen that the graph goes across five and therefore divided 35 by 5, but the x-axis is labelled using 100's not 1's.",
        "D": "Not quite! It looks like you have found the fixed cost (the cost the calls start at). To calculate the additional cost we need to find the cost for two different lengths of calls, and then compare the costs and the number of minutes. Then you can find the cost per minute"

How many units charged at this rate has she used?",
        "B": "The graph shows us that Lethna pays £25 for the first 100 units. She pays a further £10 per 100 units. We add £20 onto £75 to get £95 for 800 units as the graph only shows us to 600 units.",

How many units charged at this rate has she used?",
        "C": "After the first100 units, 100 units costs £10. An extra 400 units will cost 4 × £10 = £40, so we can add that to the cost of 600 units, which gives £75 + £40 = £115.",
