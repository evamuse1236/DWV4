        "B": "Not quite - a rate of change can be calculated by difference in 𝑦 ÷ difference in 𝑥. Try comparing two columns in Katie's table to see what the rate of change is.",
        "C": "They can't both be true, as it's not possible for both rates to be greater than each other at the same time. In a function, the rate of change is given by the slope. In a table, the rate of change can be calculated by difference in 𝑦 ÷ difference in 𝑥. Which one would give us a greater rate?",
