        "A": "Looking at the graph we can see point V is located at (0,0) and point W is located at (8,5). This means we need to move 8 to the right and 5 up to travel from point V to W. As we are told the points are equally spaced along the line, we would also need to move 8 right and 5 up to travel from W to X and from X to Y. Therefore, the coordinates of point X are (16,10) which means the coordinates of point Y will be (24,15).",

The points are equally spaced, therefore to move from V to W we would move 6 right (18 ÷ 3) and 1 down (3 ÷ 3). Therefore the coordinates of W are (6,-1) and the coordinates of X will be (12,-2).",
        "C": "Not quite, this is the midpoint of V and Y. Starting at V, how far right and down will you need to move to get to Y? Use this as well as the fact that the points are equally spaced to find the movement between V and W. Then make same movement to get to from W to X.",

Doing the same between the points A and C, gives us a right-angled triangle of base 8 and a height that we need to find. We know that the lines AB and AC have the same slope, which means the two right-angled triangles are similar and their sides are in the same proportion. 3/1 is the same as 24/8. Therefore the vertical height between A and C must be 24. Starting at 3 (point A) and going up 24 gets us to 27. Therefore the y coordinate of point C is 27."

We know that the lines AB and AC have the same slope, which means the two right-angled triangles are similar and their sides are in the same proportion. 4/1 is the same as 20/5.
