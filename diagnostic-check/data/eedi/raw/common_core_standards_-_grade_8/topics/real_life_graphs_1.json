        "A": "The gradient of this graph is steeper at the start and then flattens out. This shows that the depth is increasing more quickly at the start. If the depth increases quickly does this mean our glass has a narrow or wide base? Our gradient then gradually reduces. What might this mean in terms of the width of the glass?",
        "B": "The gradient of this graph is steeper at the start and then flattens out. This shows that the depth is increasing more quickly at the start. If the depth increases quickly does this mean our glass has a narrow or wide base?",
        "C": "The glass we're looking for does have a narrower base and a wider top, but Glass C is made up of 2 distinct widths which would lead to an obvious change on our graph where the gradient changed. Our graph is much smoother than this. Which glass changes more gradually from narrow to wide?",
        "D": "The gradient of this graph is steeper at the start and then flattens out. This shows that the depth is increasing more quickly at the start meaning the width of the glass is smaller. As it is a smooth curve it means the glass gradually gets wider towards the top, rather than a sudden change, hence glass D, not C"

When John stops for a rest, his displacement does not change so the line on the graph is horizontal. In the last part of the journey, John is travelling towards home so the line needs to slope downwards, as his displacement away from home gets smaller. The line also needs to be steeper than the first part of the journey, to show that John is moving faster (running)."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Velocity is speed in a given direction. We can see from the velocity-time graph that the velocity is constant, as the line is horizontal, therefore John is moving at a constant speed. The velocity then drops to 0 showing that John has stopped. The velocity then increases to higher than before showing John has increased his speed and is therefore running, the line is also shorter after his break showing it took him less time to run 1km than walk 1km",
        "B": "I think you have drawn a displacement-time graph by accident instead of a velocity time graph. Looking at the diagram, we can see velocity is increasing as the line goes from zero, upwards. This shows John is accelerating, not moving at a constant speed. The line is then horizontal showing that the velocity doesn't change so John is at a constant speed. Then the gradient becomes negative showing John's speed is decreasing. Which one is the correct velocity-time graph?",
        "C": "Almost! Looking at this velocity-time graph, we can see John was at a lower constant speed to get to the bench and a higher constant speed after stopping at the bench. This implies he walked first and then ran on from the bench. However, look again at the lengths of the lines. These represent the time taken. Would it take you longer to walk 1km or run 1km?",
        "D": "Careful! This is the correct displacement-time graph, however the question has asked you which diagram illustrates John's journey as a velocity-time graph. Remember velocity is speed in a given direction."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Almost! Looking at the velocity-time graph in A, it shows it took John longer to run 1km than to walk 1km as the first line is much longer. This doesn't make sense. Which graph shows John taking less time to run than to walk?",
        "B": "Careful! This is the correct displacement-time graph, however the question has asked you which diagram illustrates John's journey as a velocity-time graph. Remember velocity is speed in a given direction.",
        "C": "We can see from the velocity-time graph that John has a high, constant speed for a short time. This shows him running to the bench. The line then drops to zero showing that John has stopped. John's velocity then increases, to show he is moving again. However this time, the line is lower showing John is travelling more slowly and the line is longer showing it has taken him more time to travel the second kilometre. This makes sense for the journey given in the question as it would take less time to run 1km than to walk 1km",
        "D": "I think you have accidentally drawn John's journey as a displacement-time graph, rather than a velocity-time graph. If we look at what this graph's journey would be: the velocity starts off by increasing so John would be accelerating rather than walking at a constant speed. Then the horizontal line shows John is at a constant speed. John's velocity then decreases showing he is slowing down. Which of the other diagrams illustrates John's journey as a velocity-time graph?"
