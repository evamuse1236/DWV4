        "A": "The power that 10 is raised to is different for each bracket, namely −3 and −4. This means that the 3 of 3.2 and 4 of 4.7, for example, have different place values. We could write the values as normal numbers to show the issue better: 0.0032 − 0.00047 = 0.00273 = 2.73 × 10^(−3). However, this can be time consuming, especially if the powers are very large. Another way of tackling the problems is to ensure the powers are to the same value and then factorise: 3.2 × 10^(−3) − 4.7 × 10^(−4) = 3.2 × 10^(−3) − 0.47 × 10^(−3) = 10^(−3) × (3.2 − 0.47) = 2.73 × 10^(−3)",
