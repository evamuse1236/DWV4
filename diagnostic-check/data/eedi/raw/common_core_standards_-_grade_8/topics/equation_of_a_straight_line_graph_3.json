This can be explanded to 30 - 15 = 15, because this is true we know (6, -5) lies on the line. We then substituted for Katie (-6, 15) and had 5(-6) + 3(15) = 30.

For Jo’s (10, −4), we have 4 × 10 − 5 × −4 = 20. The left-hand side works out as 40 − (−20) = 60, which doesn't equal 20, so (10, −4) does not lie on the line. Repeating this for Paul’s (−4, 10), we have 4 × −4 − 5 × 10 = 20. This gives −16 − 50 = 20, which is clearly not true and so (−4, 10) does not lie on the line either."
