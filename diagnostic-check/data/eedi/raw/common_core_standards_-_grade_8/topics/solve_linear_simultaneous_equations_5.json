For Pair 2, initially one equation needs to be rearranged: let’s do this to equation 1: swapping the 𝑥 and 𝑦 terms, taking care to keep the appropriate sign with each gives −𝑥 + 𝑦 = 5. Now, to eliminate 𝑥, let’s add this equation to 𝑥 − 𝑦 = 5. For the 𝑥 term, this gives −𝑥 + 𝑥 = 0, and for the y term there is +𝑦 +(− 𝑦) = 0. The number-only term is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, to eliminate 𝑥, let’s add this equation to 2𝑥 − 2𝑦 = 7. For the x term, this gives −2𝑥 + 2𝑥 = 0, and for the y term there is +2𝑦 +(− 2𝑦) = 0. The number-only term is 7 + 7 = 14. Since 0 ≠ 14, Pair 1 has no solutions. If we were to draw a graph of each equation, we would find that these lines do not meet and are therefore parallel.

The right hand side is 5 − 10 = −5. Since 0 ≠ −5, Pair 1 has no solutions. There is a similar situation for Pair 2: add both equations to get 0𝑦 + 0𝑥 = 0 on the left-hand side and 15 on the right-hand side, which is impossible and so we can conclude there are no solutions to Pair 2 either.",

If the two equations are then added, we have −2𝑦 = 8, which means this pair of equations has obvious solutions. In Pair 2, equation 1 should also be rearranged to give −𝑥 + 𝑦 = −4. With equation 2 remaining as 𝑥 − 𝑦 = −4, adding this pair for the 𝑥 terms gives −𝑥 + 𝑥 = 0𝑥 = 0, and for the 𝑦 term: −𝑦 + (+𝑦) = −𝑦 + 𝑦 = 0. The number-only terms give −4 +(−4) = −8.
