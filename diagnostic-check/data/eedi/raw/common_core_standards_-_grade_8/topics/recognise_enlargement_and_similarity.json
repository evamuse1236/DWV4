Only Katie is correct because all the sides of her rectangle have been enlarged by the same scale factor, 2, when compared with the original rectangle. Therefore they are similar. For Tom's rectangle, the shorter side has been enlarged by scale factor 1.5. Therefore, for Tom's rectangle to be similar to the original one, the longer side would also have to be enlarged by scale factor 1.5, making it 4.5 squares long. This is not the case, so Tom's rectangle is not similar to the original one.",

        "A": "For 2 shapes to be similar, the lengths of all their sides must have been enlarged by the same scale factor. Only Tom is correct because all the sides of his rectangle have been halved when compared with the original rectangle. Therefore they are similar. For Katie's rectangle, the shorter side has been enlarged by scale factor 1.5 (4cm ✕ 1.5=6cm). Therefore, for Katie's rectangle to be similar to the original one, the longer side would also have to be enlarged by scale factor 1.5, making it 7cm ✕ 1.5=10.5cm long.

Tom is correct because all the sides of his rectangle have been enlarged by scale factor ¼ (divided by 4) when compared with the original rectangle. Therefore they are similar. Katie is also correct.

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Because the two triangles are similar, we know that all sides will have been enlarged by the same scale factor. We first need to calculate the scale factor by comparing the corresponding sides. The 4cm side in the smaller triangle corresponds to the 6cm side in the larger triangle. 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5. Therefore, we know that the 5cm side in the smaller triangle must be multiplied by 1.5 to find the corresponding length in the larger triangle. 5 ✕ 1.5 = 7.5cm",
