        "A": "I think you have the right idea, but how many seconds are in a minute?",
        "B": "It looks like you have read from the time (seconds) axis. Using the line labelled 'Q', we need to read across to the y axis to work out how much water leaks in a certain time (for example, 30 seconds) and then use this to find the rate per 60 seconds",
        "C": "Using the 'Q' line we can see that the amount of water has dropped from 10 litres to 4 litres in 30 seconds. So a rate of 6 litres per 30 seconds, which scaling up gives us 12 litres per minute.",
        "D": "It looks like you have worked out how much water leaks per second, but we want the rate per minute. How can you scale up your answer so that the rate is per minute?"

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Using the 'P' line we can see that the amount of water has dropped from 14 litres to 0 litres in 40 seconds. Therefore, it is leaking at a rate of 0.35 l per second (14/40). We can multiply this by 60 to get the rate per minute. 0.35 x 60 = 21 litres per minute",
        "B": "I think you might have made a mistake when converting your rate from litres per second to litres per minute. How many seconds are in a minute?",
        "C": "It looks like you have worked out how much water leaks per second, but we want the rate per minute. How can you change your answer to get this?",
        "D": "14 litres leaked out of container P in 40 seconds. That gives us a rate of 14 litres per 40 seconds. How can we scale this up to get a rate per 60 seconds?"
