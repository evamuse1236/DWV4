        "A": "The line to the right of the graph shows a gradual slope down to the x-axis indicating he came out of a deep sleep over some period of time. This does not fit with being awoken suddenly by a car alarm. Which graph matches this sudden wake up?",
        "B": "Graph B shows a steep line from a deep sleep back down to the x-axis which would indicate he was awakened sharply. This matches a quick wake up by a sudden noise. The fact that there is no further line into sleep matches the description that he could not get back to sleep.",
        "C": "This graph shape shows someone taking some time to get into a deep sleep, with deep sleep only occurring much later in the night. This does not match the description that he slept really well until the car alarm. Which graph has a better match for this description of his initial sleep?",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Remember that acceleration happens when velocity increases, which also means that the change in distance over time is not constant. Which of these graphs might represent this? Also notice that the two graphs are different types: Tom's is a Distance-Time graph, Katie's is a Velocity-Time graph.",
        "B": "Remember that acceleration happens when velocity increases, which also means that the change in distance over time is not constant. Which of these graphs might represent this? Also notice that the two graphs are different types: Tom's is a Distance-Time graph, Katie's is a Velocity-Time graph.",
        "C": "Acceleration happens when velocity increases, which also means that the change in distance over time is increasing more each second. Representing this on a Distance-Time graph, we would see a upward curve as the distance travelled per unit time would increase more and more as time went on, so Tom's graph is correct. Representing acceleration on a Velocity-Time graph would show velocity increasing as time went on: Katie's graph does represent a constant acceleration. So both are correct.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Notice that Tom and Katie's graphs are different types (Tom's is a Velocity-Time graph, while Katie's is Distance-Time). Think about what happens to the speed and the distance over time for an object travelling at a constant speed.",
        "B": "Notice that Tom and Katie's graphs are different types (Tom's is a Velocity-Time graph, while Katie's is Distance-Time). Think about what happens to the speed and the distance over time for an object travelling at a constant speed.",
        "C": "If an object is travelling at a constant speed, it's speed will not change over the time period. This is shown correctly as a horizontal line in Tom's speed-time graph. If an object is travelling at a constant speed, it's displacement (distance) will be changing at a constant rate, resulting in a diagonal straight line graph as seen in Katies distance-time graph, therefore she is also correct.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "A straight line sloping up means that the displacement will change by the same amount with each unit of time. So this means the object has a constant speed.",
        "B": "A horizontal line means that the displacement is not changing as time goes by. So this would show the object is not moving. If the object is travelling at constant speed, what will that look like on the graph?",
        "C": "A vertical line would represent an infinite change in displacement, happening instantaneously. Since time is always passing, this is not possible which is why we don't usually see vertical lines on displacement vs time graphs. Constant speed means that the displacement is changing steadily with time. Which line shows that?",
        "D": "A line that curves upwards represents a low speed at the start (small gradient = small change in distance per unit time) then increasing to higher speed (larger gradient = larger change in distance in the same unit time). So this line represents an object accelerating. Constant speed means that the speed is not changing. Which line shows that?"

      "explanations": {
        "A": "A straight line sloping up means that the displacement is changing by the same amount with each unit of time. So this line represents an object at constant speed. We want the object to be accelerating, or getting faster with time. Which graph shows that?",
        "B": "A horizontal line means that the displacement is not changing as time goes by. So this line shows an object that is not moving. If the object is accelerating, it will be getting faster as time goes by. What will that look like on a graph?",
        "C": "A vertical line would represent an infinite change in displacement, happening instantaneously. Since time is always passing, this is not possible which is why we don't usually see vertical lines on displacement vs time graphs. 'Accelerating' means getting faster with time. Which line shows that?",
        "D": "A line that curves upwards represents a low speed at the start (small gradient = small change in distance per unit time) then increasing to higher speed (larger gradient = larger change in distance in the same unit time). So this line represents an object accelerating."

        "A": "The curve in graph A gets gradually steeper suggesting it is increasing more quickly towards the end of the time, which doesn't match the description of p given. You could test some values to help you think about what would happen and if that would match any of the graphs given.",
        "B": "The curve in graph B is initially very steep, and then begins to flatten out, suggesting that p has increased very quickly and then slowed down to a constant value for p, this doesn't match the description given, because p hasn't increased quickly again.",
        "C": "The description of p has three distinct phases. Quicker increasing results in a steeper curve on the graph, therefore we are looking for a steep starting curve, p then increases more slowly, so we want a less steep curve for the middle section, and then p increases quickly again, so we need a steep curve again, which matches graph C.",
        "D": "We need to think about the three phases of p described. At the start, p needs to increase quickly, whereas on this graph, p is increasing slowly (shown by the gradual curve). This is then followed by a quick increase, and then another slow increase, which is the opposite of the description we need to match."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The curve in graph A gets gradually steeper suggesting continued quicker increasing over the time period, which doesn't match the description of p given as we need it to show p increasing more slowly at the end again. Remember that p increasing quickly gives a steeper curve for that section.",
        "B": "The curve in graph B is initially very steep, and then begins to flatten out, suggesting that p has increased very quickly and then slowed down to a constant value for p, this doesn't match the description given, because p starts increasing slowly, and gets quicker in the middle.",
        "C": "We need to think about the three phases of p described. This graph shows p increasing quickly, then increasing more slowly, followed by increasing quickly again. We want the opposite.",
        "D": "The description of p has three distinct phases. Increasing quickly results in a steeper curve on the graph, therefore we are looking for a curve which starts out less steep, then gets steep, then starts to taper off again. Graph D matches this pattern."
