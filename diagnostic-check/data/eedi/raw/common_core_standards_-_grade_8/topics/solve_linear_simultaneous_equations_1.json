Comparing this equation to equation 2 shows us that the coefficient in front of the n's is different in both equations, meaning we will not be able to eliminate n. Which transformation will ensure that the coefficient of n is the same in both equations?",

Subtracting equation 2 from this equation will leave us with m = 8 + 4n, which has not eliminated the n's.
