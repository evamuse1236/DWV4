        "A": "Not quite! It looks like you added 5 to both sides to get 8 = 2a. What do you need to do to work out what a single a is worth?",

This has been done correctly here. If inverses have been correctly applied in this step, which step has not correctly applied an inverse?",
        "C": "Not quite. To solve the equation we must divide both sides by 2, as we know 2 x p = -4. This has been done correctly here. If inverses have been correctly applied in this step, which step has not correctly applied an inverse?",
