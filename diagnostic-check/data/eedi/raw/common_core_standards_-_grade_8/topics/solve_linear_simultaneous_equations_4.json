        "A": "I think you have made a mistake when eliminating y. When subtracting the equations, the y terms will eliminate each other and you will be left with (3x - 2x) = (14 - 10). What would x be?",
        "B": "Not quite. Make sure you rearrange your equation so we are finding y NOT 2y.",
        "C": "The signs of the terms of the variable we are trying to eliminate are the same, so we would subtract one equation from the other. This would leave us with x = 4. If we substitute this into the second equation we get 8 + 2y = 10. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2y = 2, and dividing both sides by 2 give y = 1. Therefore, x = 4 and y = 1.",

        "C": "Not quite, your solution should work for both equations. Substituting x = 5 and y = -2 into 2x + 3y gives 4 NOT 13. The first step in solving this simultaneous equation is to subtract the first equation from the second, this will eliminate the y variable.",
