The first part requires writing the digits in a way that the value is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10. The second part requres writing × 10 to an integer power. Looking at the values in answer A–D, the value of the first part for answer D does not fit this rule because 0.7 < 1. Therefore, this is not in standard form."

The digits should be written in a way that the value is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10, the zeros between the 3 and 1 should be included in this.
