        "C": "$84 split across the 8 hours would mean Shari's hourly pay is $10.50. Well done!",
        "D": "You have multiplied here! Think what 'per hour' means. If Shari receives $84 for 8 hours, you are working out how much she would be paid for just 1 hour."

        "B": "It looks like you have added the values together. Think about how much Evan gets paid each hour, then how much he would be paid for 7 hours of work.",

        "A": "I think you have divided the amount of cans by the cost. If you are finding the final cost, you need to do the cost divided by the number of cans.",

        "C": "Almost, make sure you are selecting the cheaper cost per bag.",
