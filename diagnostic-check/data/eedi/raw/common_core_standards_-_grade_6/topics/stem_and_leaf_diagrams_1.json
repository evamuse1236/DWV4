        "B": "I think you may have picked 1 as it is the stem with the most pieces of data. However, these pieces of data do not represent the same age. They mean 11, 12, 12, 13, 13 and 15. Is there one age in the whole stem and leaf diagram that appears the most?",
        "C": "There are 2 people who are aged 12, but if you continue to look at the data there are also 2 people aged 13. Can you find an age which is shared by more than 2 people?",
        "D": "You have seen that 2 is the most common digit in the leaf parts, but remember these do not represent an age of 2. The first 2 is in the 1 stem so represents someone who is 12 years old. Do all 2s represent someone who is 12? We must use the key and consider both the stem and the leaf when finding the mode."
