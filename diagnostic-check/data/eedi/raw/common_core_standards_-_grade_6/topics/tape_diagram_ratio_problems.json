        "C": "I think you have assumed that each part of the tape diagram represents 24 treats but 24 is the number of cat treats. How many parts of the tape diagram are represented by the 24 cat treats? Can you use that to find what 1 part represents?",
        "D": "Cats have 2 parts of the tape diagram which represents 24 treats, so 1 part represents 24 ÷ 2 = 12 treats. Dogs have 3 parts of the tape diagram, so 3 × 12 = 36 treats for dogs."

We know that oil has 1 part and that 0.8 gallons of oil is used, so 1 part = 0.8 gallons. If 1 part = 0.8 gallons, how many gallons in 5 parts?",
        "B": "Oil has 1 part of the tape diagram which represents 0.8 gallons. Gas has 5 parts of the tape diagram, so 5 × 0.8 = 4 so there are 4 gallons of gas in the mixture.",

        "D": "Vinegar has 3 parts of the tape diagram which represents 0.75 gallons, so 1 part represents 0.75 ÷ 3 = 0.25 gallons. Oil has 5 parts of the tape diagram, so 5 × 0.25 = 1.25, so there are 1.25 gallons of oil in the mixture."
