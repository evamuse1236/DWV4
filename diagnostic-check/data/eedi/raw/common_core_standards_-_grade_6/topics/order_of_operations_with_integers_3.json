        "A": "Consider 8 ＋ 12 ÷ 4. The division takes priority over addition, so must be done first to give 8 ＋ 3 = 11. Now look at (8 ＋ 12) ÷ 4. Brackets take priority over division, so must be done first to give 20 ÷ 4 = 5. And 11 > 5 ( the \">\" always points to the smaller number).",

        "A": "Tom is correct because the inclusion of brackets means that 3 ＋ 6 is performed before the multiplication. For Katie's 3 ＋ 6 ✕ 2, the multiplication takes priority over addition, so her answer is 15.",

        "A": "You may have forgotten your order of operations. Addition and Subtraction have the same level of priority so you just work from left to right, unless there are brackets.",
        "B": "You may have forgotten that you have to carry out the calculation in the brackets before any other calculation",
        "C": "Addition and subtraction have equal priority; therefore, the calculations should be carried out from left to right. Please note that you can perform the addition first, but the calculation should be viewed as 6 ＋ ⁻3 ＋ 2, otherwise the temptation could be to view it as 6 − 5",

        "A": "You may not have realised that the subtraction applies to everything inside the brackets. You must work out the bracketed calculation first and then the subtraction.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Because the 12 − 8 is all multiplied by 3, brackets are necessary around it to ensure this happens. The answer to this has 2 added on to it: (12 − 8) ✕ 3 ＋ 2. Because addition does not take priority over brackets or multiplication, it will be done last anyway, so no brackets required.",
        "B": "You may have written it out in the order it is described without including the necessary brackets. Brackets are needed to ensure the calculations are carried out in the right order.",

Because the last addition does not take priority over brackets or multiplication, it will be the last step anyway, so no brackets required.",
