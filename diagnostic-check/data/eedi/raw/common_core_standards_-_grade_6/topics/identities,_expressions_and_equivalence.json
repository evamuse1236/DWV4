        "A": "To use an identity sign, the expressions on either side must be true for ALL values of y. Tom is correct because both of his expressions contain the same terms: a positive 5y and a positive 7. Katie is not correct because the terms in each of her expressions have different signs.",

        "C": "Not quite. For an identity symbol to be used, the expressions on each side of it must ALWAYS be equal. Would both statements be true for all values of y?",
        "D": "At least one person is correct here. Remember the identity sign means 'is always equal to.' You could try substituting in some values for y to see if 5y + 7 is always equal to 7 + 5y (Tom) or if 5y - 7 is always equal to 7 - 5y (Katie)."
