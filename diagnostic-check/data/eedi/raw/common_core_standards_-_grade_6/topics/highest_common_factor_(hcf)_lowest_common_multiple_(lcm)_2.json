      "explanations": {
        "A": "Nearly! You have learnt what multiples are! Multiplying two numbers together (10 x 12 = 120) will always give you a common multiple, but not always the lowest one. Try writing out the multiples of 10 and of 12, and finding the smallest one that is in both lists.",

The multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 ... The multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 ... and we can stop here because 60 is the lowest number that appears in both lists."

        "A": "You've given the highest common factor :) but this question is asking about multiples. Think about your 6 and 12 times tables. What value is the first that they have in common?",
        "B": "The multiples of 6 are 6, 12... and the multiples of 12 are 12, 24..., so the LCM is 12 as this is the lowest to appear in both sequences.",

        "C": "You have found a common multiple - good work, but how do you know it's the lowest? Try writing out the multiples of 5 and 10 and 12, and then you can find the smallest number that occurs in all three lists.",
