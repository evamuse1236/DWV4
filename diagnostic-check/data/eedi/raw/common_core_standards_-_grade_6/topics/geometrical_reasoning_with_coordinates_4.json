        "A": "Not quite, only one of these values is correct. Comparing the coordinates of the points forming the base of the parallelogram will help you find the other value.",

Applying this to (?, ?) and (6,7), we can see that the x-coordinate of (?, ?) must be 6 - 4 = 2, and the two points must have the same y-value, 7, as the top and bottom lines of the shape must be parallel, so we have (2, 7).",

        "D": "I think you've chosen 3 for your x-coordinate because that is half of 6, like 4 is half of 8. We're not looking at the multiplicative relationship here, we need to look at the difference between the points instead."

        "D": "Think carefully about where the point (10,6) would be in relation to (5,8). 10 would make it further to the right, and 6 would make it lower, however the point (?, ?) is above and to the left. Try to compare (5,8) and (12,8) to help you find the correct coordinates."
