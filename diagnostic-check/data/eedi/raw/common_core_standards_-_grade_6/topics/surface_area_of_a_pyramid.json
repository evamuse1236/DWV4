        "B": "I think you have forgotten to divide by two at the end of finding the area of the triangle. You have also used units for volume rather than area.",
        "C": "Almost! You have used units for volume rather than area.",
        "D": "The square has area 4 × 4 = 16, and each triangle has area 3 × 4 / 2 = 6. The surface area is then 16 + 4 × 6 = 40 cm²."
