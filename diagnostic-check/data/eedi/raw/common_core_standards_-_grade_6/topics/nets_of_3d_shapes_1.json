        "C": "The shape is a triangular-based pyramid or tetrahedron. We can see the base triangle in the middle of the net and then the other 3 triangles would fold upwards to make the sloping faces.",

We already have 1 triangle and 1 square. This tells us that our rectangles are actually squares so we need 1 more triangle and 2 more squares.",
