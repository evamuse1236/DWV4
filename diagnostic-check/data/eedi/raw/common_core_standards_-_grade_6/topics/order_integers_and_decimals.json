      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite. I think you might have compared the hundreds digits, but forgotten to look at the thousands digits. We must always compare digits, starting in the greatest place value column.",
        "B": "The first digit in each is the same (5). So we look at the digit in the thousands column. In the first number this is a 4 so we know it is the smallest. For the remaining two numbers, the first three digits are the same (5,7 and 4) so we then have to compare the tens digits. The middle number has a tens digit of 2 which is smaller than the last number which has a tens digit of 3. Therefore they go from left to right, smallest to biggest. The less than symbol (<) will need to be used both times to show that the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right.",
        "C": "Not quite. These symbols mean that the number on the left is greater than the number on the right (greater > smaller). Is that the case?",
        "D": "Not quite. You have made one mistake. Make sure you look at the digit in each column carefully to decide which is largest, and always start from greatest place value column."

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Not quite. Remember that this symbol (<) means that the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right, and this symbol (>) means the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.",
        "B": "Not quite. These symbols mean that the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right (smaller < greater). Is this the case with all 3 numbers?",
        "C": "Not quite. These symbols mean that the number on the left is greater than the number on the right (greater > smaller). Is this the case with all 3 numbers?",
        "D": "The first digit in each is the same (7). So we look at the digit in the thousands column. In the first two numbers this is a 6, but in the last it is a 4 so we know that the last number is the smallest. For the remaining two numbers, the first three digits are the same (7,6 and 4) so we then have to compare the tens digits. The first number has a tens digit of 2 which is smaller than the middle number which has a tens digit of 6. Therefore the answer should be 76 426 < 76 462 > 74 662 because this symbol (<) means that the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right, and this symbol (>) means the number on the left is greater than the number on the right."

In the first and second numbers this is a 7, but in the last number is is a 5 so we know that 0.570 is the smallest. We then have to look to the hundredths digit to find the difference between the first 2 numbers as they have the same number of tenths. The first number has a hundredths digit of 0 which is smaller than the middle number which has a hundredths digit of 5. Therefore the answer is 0.705 < 0.750 > 0.570 as 0.705 is less than (<) 0.750, but 0.750 is greater than (>) 0.570."
