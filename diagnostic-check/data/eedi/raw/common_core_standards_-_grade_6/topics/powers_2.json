Look at the last digit: as no numbers end with the digit 5 (which they wouldn’t because they are all even), there will never be a situation where 2^m ends in 0. Similarly, powers of 5 are 5, 25, 125, 10625. The last digit is always 5, and multiplying this by 5 to get the next digit will always result in a last digit of 5.",
