        "A": "With problems such as these where there is a triangle within a triangle, it can be helpful to draw the triangles separately. Imagine the 4 cm triangle on the left and the 16 cm triangle on the right. We can write: 4 ✕ ? = 16, giving ?, the constant of proportionality, as 4. This means that the length of the side on the larger triangle that corresponds to x will be 4x. The question asks only for a part of the 4x length, namely 4x – x = 3x. This means that the ratio of x : y is x : 3x, or dividing both sides by x gives the simplified answer of 1 : 3.",
        "B": "I think you have divided 16 by 4 to get the ratio BUT this division is telling us how many times bigger the lengths of the larger triangle are. Draw out the separate triangles, put a number in for x and find out the length on the big triangle. You can then work out what y is and use these numbers in your ratio",

        "A": "With problems such as these where there is a triangle within a triangle, it can be helpful to draw the triangles separately. Imagine the 8 cm triangle on the left and the 20 cm triangle on the right. We can write: 8 ✕ ? = 20, giving ?, the constant of proportionality, as 2.5. This means that the length of the side on the larger triangle that corresponds to x will be 2.5x. The question asks only for a part of the 2.5x length, namely 2.5x – x = 1.5x. This means that the ratio of x : y is x : 1.5x, or dividing both sides by x gives the simplified answer of 1 : 1.5, and multiplying by 2 gives whole number values of 2 : 3.",
