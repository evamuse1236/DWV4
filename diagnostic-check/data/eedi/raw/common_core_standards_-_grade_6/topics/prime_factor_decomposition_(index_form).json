        "A": "You have found two prime numbers here but 11 x 13 = 143. We need prime numbers that multiply to give 105. Start by thinking what 105 can be divided by.",
        "B": "105 is in the 5 times table because it ends with a 5. 5 is also a prime number and 105 = 5 x 21. 21 is not prime, so we need to find the factors of 21 that are prime. 21 = 3 x 7 and 3 and 7 are both prime. So the prime factors of 105 are 5, 3 and 7. Writing 105 as a product (multiplication) of its prime factors, we have 105 = 3 x 5 x 7.",
        "C": "You have found a pair of factors that multiply to give 105. But we only want factors that are prime numbers. Are 5 and 21 both prime numbers? We need to keep breaking up any factors that are not prime until our product (multiplication) only contains prime numbers.",
        "D": "105 is not a prime number as it has other factors, apart from 1 and 105. What other whole numbers could we divide 105 by? The final digit might give you a clue."

        "B": "You have found some factors that multiply to give 150. But we only want factors that are prime numbers. Are 2, 5 and 15 all prime numbers? We need to keep breaking up any factors that are not prime until our product (multiplication) only contains prime numbers.",
        "C": "150 is in the 10 times table because it ends with a 0. 150 = 10 x 15. 10 and 15 are not prime numbers so we need to find the factors of 10 and 15 that are prime. 10 = 2 x 5 and 2 and 5 are both prime. 15 = 3 x 5 and 3 and 5 are both prime. Therefore 150 = 10 x 15 = (2 x 5) x (3 x 5). So the prime factors of 150 are 2, 3 and 5. Writing 150 as a product (multiplication) of its prime factors, we have 150 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 5.",
