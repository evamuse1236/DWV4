        "B": "I think you have found the connection between the cups of flour and the cups of sugar. How can you use that to work out how much flour you need with 7 cups of sugar?",
        "C": "I think you may have gone for the one closest using the markers on the number line. 9 cups of flour would be what you need for 6 cups of sugar. How many cups of flour would you need for 7 cups of sugar?",
        "D": "The cups of flour are 1.5 (or 3/2) times the cups of sugar. When sugar is 7 cups, flour will be 7 x 1.5 = 10.5 cups. Or 7 x 3/2 = 21/2 = 10 1/2."

        "A": "I think you may have looked at going from 4 gallons to 1 gallon is subtract 3 and have done that to the 30 miles. Can you use the 30 miles being equal to 4 gallons to work how many miles would be equal to 1 gallon? What operation would you need to do? Remember every gallon will be the same number of miles.",
        "B": "We can see from the number line that 4 gallons of gas gives 30 miles. To find 1 gallon, 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5. So you could travel 7.5 miles with one gallon of gas.",

        "C": "I think you may have looked at going from 15 seconds to 1 second is subtract 14 and have done that to the 100 metres sprinted. Can you use the 100 metres being equal to 15 seconds to work how many meters would be equal to 1 second? What operation would you need to do? Remember every second will be the same number of metres.",
        "D": "100 metres is equal to 15 seconds. To get to 1 second we divide the number of metres by the number of seconds. 100 ÷ 15 = 20/3 = 6 2/3. Using fractions can help to make sure you have an exact answer."
