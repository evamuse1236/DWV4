        "A": "You might have forgotten that it is possible to rearrange the order of our terms as long as we keep the correct signs with the correct terms. e.g. a - b would be the same as -b + a",
        "B": "Not quite. Remember we can reorder our terms as long as we keep them with the correct sign. So we could have our numbers first or our letters first.",
        "C": "The −3 outside the brackets indicates that every term inside is multiplied by −3. This gives −3(1 − 2𝑝) = (−3 × 1) − (−3 × 2𝑝) = −3 − (−6𝑝) = −3 + 6𝑝 (because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive value). Tom is therefore correct because −3 + 6𝑝 is his answer; however, Katie is also correct because she has swapped the order of the numbers, taking care to keep the correct sign with its value: −3 + 6𝑝 = +6𝑝 + (−3) = 6𝑝 − 3",
        "D": "Not quite. You may have struggled with your negatives here. A negative multiplied by a negative becomes a positive. For example -3 x -2 = 6"

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The −6 outside the brackets indicates that every term inside is multiplied by −6. This gives −6(2 − 3𝑝) = (−6 × 2) − (−6 × 3𝑝) = −12 − (−18𝑝) = −12 + 18𝑝 (because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive value). Jo is therefore correct because −12 + 18𝑝 is her answer. Paul is incorrect: he appears to have swapped values without taking the signs into account. For this to happen correctly, note that the sign in front of 12 is negative, and this must remain so. The value 18𝑝 has a positive sign, and this too must remain, giving the correct equivalent expression of +18𝑝 − 12, or simply 18𝑝 − 12",
