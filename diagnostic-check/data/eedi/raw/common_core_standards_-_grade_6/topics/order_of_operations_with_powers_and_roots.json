If you add those together, what do you get? Now if we calculate Katie's: what is 16 + 9? What would be the square root of this total? So who is correct?",

        "C": "I think you have doubled 8 to get 16 and then square rooted this to get 4. The square rooting part is great but the little 2 means we have to square 8, not double it. Squaring 8 means calculating 8 x 8. Once you have this answer square root it like you did before.",
        "D": "I think you have accidentally doubled 8 to get 16. The little 2 next to the 8 is index notation telling us we have to square the number, not double it. Then the radical symbol (the box over 8 squared) tells us we have to square root this answer. 8 x 8 = ? now sqaure root your answer."

        "B": "I think you have accidentally halved 10 and then squared this answer. Let's go through the mathematical symbols shown and what they mean. The little 2 is index notation telling us we have to square 10. This means times 10 by itself: 10 x 10 = ?. Then the box (radical symbol) over the 10 squared means square root so we have to take our answer to 10 x 10 and square root it.",
