        "C": "Area of a triangle = ½ ✕ base ✕ perpendicular height. Looking at the light blue triangle, we can say its area = ½ ✕ p ✕ r = ½ ✕ pr = pr/2. Similarly, area dark blue triangle = qr/2, giving total area = pr/2 ＋ qr/2, which is Tom’s statement. Now, if we view the triangle as a whole with a base = (p ＋ q), then area of a triangle = ½ ✕ base ✕ perpendicular height = ½ ✕ (p ＋ q) ✕ r, which is the same as Katie’s statement. Alternatively, factorising Tom’s expression will also give Katie’s.",
