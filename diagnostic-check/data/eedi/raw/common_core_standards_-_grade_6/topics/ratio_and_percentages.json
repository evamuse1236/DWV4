        "A": "If Isaac gets 20% fewer sweets than Katie then they share the sweets in the ratio 80 : 100 or 4 : 5. This means they are dividing the sweets into 9 equal parts and Isaac will get four of them. 495 ÷ 9 equals 55 and 55 x 4 gives 220. Therefore Isaac gets 220 sweets.",

To solve questions like this we need to think of Katie's share as 100%. What percentage will Isaac get if he gets 20% less? Write Isaac's share to Katie's as a ratio, simplify and then solve.",
        "D": "Not quite. We need to be careful with the percentages here. We are told Isaac gets 20% fewer than Katie, this is different to Katie getting 20% more than Isaac. We need to let Katie's share represent 100% rather than Isaac's share."
