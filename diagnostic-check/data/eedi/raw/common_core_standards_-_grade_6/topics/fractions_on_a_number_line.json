        "A": "The two fractions we are comparing are 1/4 and 3/4. These are equivalent to 4/16 and 12/16. This means each jump is 2/16 so the second blue arrow is pointing to 10/16. Therefore 11/16 cannot be between the two arrows.",
        "B": "1/4 = 50/200 and 3/4 = 150/200 so this fraction would be exactly half way between them, so would be between the blue arrows",
        "C": "1/4 = 3/12 and 3/4 = 9/12. If we change 1/3 into twelfths we get 4/12 which is very close to 3/12, so this fraction would be between the blue arrows",
        "D": "1/4 = 5/20 and 3/4 = 15/20. If we change 2/5 into twentieths we get 8/20 which is less than half way between these fractions so it would lie between the blue arrows"
