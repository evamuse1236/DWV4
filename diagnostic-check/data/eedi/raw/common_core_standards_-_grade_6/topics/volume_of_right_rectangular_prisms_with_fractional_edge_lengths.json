        "C": "Volume is area of the base x height of the prism. Since the area of the base is given as 12⁴/₅ and the height is given as 6½, we just need to multiply them together.",
        "D": "I think you are confused because a formula for volume is V = lwh, but we already have the area of the base given, so we can use the formula V = bh. What you have calculated is area of base x height x height."
