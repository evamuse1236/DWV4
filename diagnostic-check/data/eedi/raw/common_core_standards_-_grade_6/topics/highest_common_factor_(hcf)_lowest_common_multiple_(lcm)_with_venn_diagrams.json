        "A": "Try testing out some values to check. You could try finding the lowest common multiple of 5 and 7, as well as 6 and 10, and then trying this method afterwards. Do you get the same answer?",
        "B": "We can multiply the numbers together only if the numbers share no factors except 1, for example 10 and 27, their LCM is 270, which is 27x10. However, if we try two numbers that do share factors other than 1, for example, 12 and 10, the LCM is 60, which is not 12x10.",

        "A": "Multiplying two numbers together will always give a common multiple. It may not be the lowest common multiple, though, depending on whether the values have any common factors. If there are common factors, then dividing by these removes any 'double-counting', and gives the lowest common multiple.",

        "C": "The numbers in the right-hand circle multiply to give 90. So we can write 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × ❤, giving 90 = 18 × ❤. This means that the missing prime factor is 5.",

        "B": "The numbers in the right-hand circle multiply to give 60. Therefore 60 = 2 × 3 × 2 × ❤, giving 60 = 12 × ❤. This means that the missing prime factor is 5.",
