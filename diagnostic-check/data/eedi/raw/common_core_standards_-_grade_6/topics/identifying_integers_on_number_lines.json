      "explanations": {
        "A": "It seems like you might think that each point on the number line increases by 2. Check carefully how many there are between -6 and -1, that will help you work out what it is going up in!",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "The number line increases by 1 with every jump. As we get closer towards 0 with negative numbers, the digits get smaller, so 2 greater than -5 would be -3.",
