      "explanations": {
        "A": "I think you might have misunderstood the way the inequality sign goes. The opening is by the bigger number.",
        "B": "Tom's first digits are both 3 and in the thousands, so they are equal value, then you move on to the second digit, where he has a 0 or a 4 in the hundreds column. 4 hundreds is larger than 0 hundreds, and so Tom is incorrect. Katie's first digits are both 3, however, one is 3 thousand and the other is 3 hundred. 3 thousand is larger, so Katie is correct.",
        "C": "Almost, make sure you are comparing digits in the same place value column, and thinking about which digit is larger.",
        "D": "Not quite, I think you've forgotten to check the place value of the digits. I often find it's simpler to think about these questions by saying the number out loud to myself first, and then it can be more obvious."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Remember, the opening of the inequality sign is always by the greater value. Jo’s statement is correct: looking at the digit furthest to the left (because this carries the most value), the 10,090 is made up of 10 thousand whereas 1,090 has only 1 thousand. Paul is incorrect: both numbers consist of 10 thousand but the smaller value has an additional 90, whereas the larger has an additional 900, meaning 10,090 < 10,900 is the correct representation, not the one given.",
        "B": "I think you may have mistaken the inequalities. The larger part of the sign is next to the larger number. The point is \"pointing\" to the smaller number.",
        "C": "Nearly, I think you may need to compare the value of the digits that have the same place value. It may help you to say the number out loud.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Try to say this number out loud, if you didn't have a 1 in front of the 2, what would the value be? You can also look at the number of digits after the 2 and compare, as there is no decimal point here.",
        "B": "The position of the digits within a number tells you the amount each contributes to the overall value of a number. Starting at the right-hand side of 12,030, the last digit 0 represents ones or units; the 3 tells us there are 3 tens, so 30; the next zero tells us there are 0 hundreds; and the 2 (the other side of the gap in the question) tells us there are 2 thousands, so 2,000.",
        "C": "I think you might have counted the zeros after the 2, remember the 3 has a place value as well.",

        "C": "I think you might have counted the zeros after the 3, remember the 7 and 5 hold a place value as well.",
        "D": "The position of the digits within a number tells you the amount each contributes to the overall value of a number. Starting at the right-hand side of 43,075, the last digit 5 represents ones or units, so 5 ones = 5; the 7 tells us there are 7 tens, so 70; the next zero tells us there are 0 hundreds; and the 3 (the other side of the gap in the question) tells us there are 3 thousands, so 3,000."

By putting the numbers given in answer C one below another, it can be seen that all have 100,000. Moving to the next digit, we can decide that 112,999 must be the smallest because both other numbers have 40,000 whereas this value has 10,000. Both other numbers also have 5,000; however, the hundreds column presents a difference in that 145,614 has 600, whereas 145,819 has 800, meaning that answer C has given the correct order.",

        "A": "First establish just how big each interval is: to do this, look at some known values, say 100 and 125. These values have a difference of 25, and the intervals marked show they have been divided into 5 equal parts, which means that each interval will have a value of 25 ÷ 5 = 5. (To check this, choose a set of values, say 150 to 175, and count up in 5s from 150. When you count as far as 175, this should correspond with the 175 marked; if not, the value of one interval is wrong.) The arrow is pointing to 1 interval (or 5) before 150, so this gives an answer of 145.",
        "B": "I think you have miscalculated the intervals as being 10 each. Make sure you find the difference between two values that are given, then count the number of intervals they have been split into, this will help you to find how much one interval is equal to.",
