        "A": "For every 6 sweets Kate has Isaac has 15. Multiplying both of these values by the same number will give an equivalent ratio. We have multiplied by 3 here, so 18:45 would be an equivalent ratio.",

        "A": "For every 6p Josh gets Lucy gets 18p. Multiplying both of these by 3 tells us that if Josh gets 18p then Lucy will get 54p, not 56. Therefore, these two ratios are not equivalent.",
        "B": "For every 6p Josh has, Lucy has 18p. 6 and 18 have a highest common factor of 6, so both numbers can be divided by 6 and remain an equivalent ratio. Therefore, 1:3 is an equivalent ratio of 6:18.",
        "C": "For every 6p Josh has, Lucy has 18p. The numbers can both be divided by 6 and remain equivalent, leaving a ratio of 1:3. Both 1 and 3 can be multiplied by 9, meaning 9:27 is equivalent to 6:18. Alternatively, 6 x 1.5 = 9 and 18 x 1.5 = 27.",
        "D": "For every 6p Josh has, Lucy has 18p. Both 6 and 18 can be divided by 3, creating an equivalent ratio of 2:6. Both 2 and 6 can be multiplied by 2, showing how 4:12 is an equivalent ratio."
