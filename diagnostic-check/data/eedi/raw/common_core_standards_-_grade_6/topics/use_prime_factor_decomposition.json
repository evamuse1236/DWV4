        "D": "We need to multiply by 10, which is 5 × 2 in prime factors. That means we need to increase the power on the 2 and the 5 by one each."

        "B": "Close! This would indeed make 1680! You have recognised that you need to multiply 168's prime factors by 10. :) You just needed to split 10 into its prime factors as well.",

        "D": "Very close! It looks like you have understood that you need to multiply the prime factor product of 168 by the prime factor product of 10 :) However, the prime factor product of 10 is not 5². That would be 5x5, which is 25. Instead, the prime factor product of 10 is 5 x 2."

Furthermore, any combination of some or all of the prime factors multiplied together will also be a factor of the number. This means 3 ✕ 3 = 9 will be a factor, and so Katie is also correct.",

Any of the primes 3, 5 or 7 will be a factor of the number, and any combination of some or all of the prime factors multiplied together will also be a factor of the number. Tom is incorrect because 10 = 2 ✕ 5, and 2 is not a factor, meaning 10 cannot be either. The number 75 = 5 ✕ 5 ✕ 3. All these appear as prime factors in the question, which means that 75 will be a factor of the number.",
