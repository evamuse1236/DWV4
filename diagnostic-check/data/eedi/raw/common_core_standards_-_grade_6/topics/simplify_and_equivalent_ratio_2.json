        "C": "First, change all measurements to the same units: 1000 ml water and 100 ml juice. The ratio tells us that water makes up 4 parts, and we will focus on this because all of this is used up. We can write 4 parts = 1000 ml, so 1 part = 1000 ÷ 4 = 250 ml. This 250 ml is the amount of juice needed, being the appropriate 1 part. However, Lucy already has 100 ml, and so only an additional 150 ml is required.",

The ratio tells us that sparkling water makes up 5 parts, and we will focus on this because all of this is used up. We can write 5 parts = 2000 ml, so 1 part = 2000 ÷ 5 = 400 ml. The mixture, however, requires 2 parts of juice, so 800 ml is the amount required. Remember, Olive already has 200 ml, and this means only an additional 600 ml is needed.",

        "C": "I think you have used the ratio the wrong way round. What number represents water in the ratio?",
        "D": "Not quite. I think you found out how much 7 parts is and then took off the 200ml. Remember we are interested in the juice that Olive needs."
