        "B": "Not quite! You have successfully shown how to indicate multiplying in algebraic expressions :). Reconsider what 'subtract five from h' means and you'll get there next time. You were close! :) In future, be careful about which way round you write subtractions to get the marks your learning deserves! :)",
        "C": "Not quite! Think about the order it means to say 'subtract five from h', if it was subtract 5 from 7, how would you write that? Also, remember that we don't always need a multiplication sign, is there a more mathematical way we could write this than x 6? You'll be ready next time! :)",
        "D": "So close! Your answer is actually correct in that this is what the description means, the expression can be written even more simply though, see if you can find the absolute best version; you were very nearly right! :)"

        "A": "Not quite! The expression is written well, but remember to think about which number is adding and which is multiplying. You'll get there next time! :)",
        "B": "This answer is correct! Adding four to h can be written as h+4 but also as 4+h, because they both give the same answer. Then we need to multiply all of that by 3, so we put it into brackets, with the three in front and no multiplication sign as we know 3 in front of the brackets means we have to multiply! :)",
        "C": "So close; great try! :) This can be written even more mathematically, can we write it in a different way where we don't need a multiplication sign? You'll get there next time! :)",
        "D": "So close; great try! :) This can be written even more mathematically, is there one part of your answer that could go in a different place perhaps? You'll get there next time! :)"
