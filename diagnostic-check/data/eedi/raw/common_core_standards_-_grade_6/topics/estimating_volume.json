        "A": "This bucket does look like it could be two cans tall, but it's width and depth look to be more than one can. Try to think about how you could arrange the cans in the base of the bucket, how many cans do you think you could fit in each layer?",
        "B": "This bucket does look to be two cans tall, but I think you could fit more than 3 cans in the bottom of it, remember that it is circular at the bottom. Try to think about how you could arrange the cans in the base of the bucket, how many cans do you think you could fit there?",
        "C": "15 cans is the most accurate estimation. If you imagine the circle at the bottom of the bucket, you could fit 6 cans in a flower shape, and the bucket looks like it is two cans tall, so you can have 2 layers of 6, 2x6=12. There will be gaps between the cans, and these could be filled by another 3 cans of soft drink.",
        "D": "I think you may have allowed too many extra cans for spaces. Try to imagine the circle of the bucket's base, and how many cans you could fit there, then consider how tall the bucket is in relation to the cans. Multiplying these should give a good estimate."

        "A": "I think you have overestimated the volume here. Try to imagine lots of those cups fitting into the bucket. Start with the bottom, how could you arrange them to fit the most in? How tall is the bucket in terms of the cups?",
        "B": "To do this question, I think about placing the whole cups inside the bucket. On the bottom layer I could arrange 6 cups in a flower type pattern. Then I'm going to think about how many layers I could have, the bucket is about 4 cups tall. That gives me 6x4=24 cups. My cups don't fit exactly into a circle, I'll have some gaps, and they can be filled by another 6 cups of tea, so in total I've used 30 cups.",
        "C": "15 is not quite the most accurate. Try to imagine lots of those cups fitting into the bucket. Start with the bottom, how could you arrange them to fit the most in? How tall is the bucket in terms of the cups?",
        "D": "I think this is nearly how many cups would fit into the bucket on the bottom layer. If we're trying to think about how many cups would fill it, you could think about how many cups tall the bucket is too."
