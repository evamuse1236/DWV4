The only option that is less than 1 is D. Working through the mathematics to get the answer, we would convert 2 2/3 to an improper fraction: 8/3 and then multiply 2 by the reciprocal of 8/3 as dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. 2/1 x 3/8 = 6/8 = 3/4."

For example if you divide by 1/2 that is the same as multiplying by 2. In this calcualtion we are dividing by 14/5 so that is the same as multiplying by 5/14. 4/1 x 5/14 = 20/14.
