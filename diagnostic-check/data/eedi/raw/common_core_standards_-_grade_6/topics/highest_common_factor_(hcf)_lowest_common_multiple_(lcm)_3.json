Imagine a Venn diagram with this prime number in the left-hand circle, say, and the other prime factors in the right-hand circle. Sometimes the overlap will be empty, for example with the numbers 7 and 6. However, if the prime number is a factor of the non-prime, the LCM will not be the product of these numbers.
