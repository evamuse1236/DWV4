The side of the square drawn shows there is a vertex at (0,2) , then moving 3 right and 1 down takes us to the next vertex at (3,1). We can now combine moves of 3 and 1 to see where the next vertex could be. From (3,1), we can move 1 left and 3 down to get to (2,-2), so Tom is correct. From (0,2) we can move 1 right and 3 up to get to (1,5), so Katie is correct too. Tom and Katie are both thinking of different squares, but they both still share that same line segment so they are both correct.",

This means the shape is a parallelogram as it has 2 pairs of parallel sides. Starting at A again, 1 right and 3 down takes us to B. This length is not equal to the line AD, and so the shape cannot be a rhombus. This means only Tom is correct.",
