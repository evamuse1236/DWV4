      "explanations": {
        "A": "The mean is affected by extreme values. 320 is far bigger than all the rest of the values so it will skew the mean. The mean for this data would actually be 42.9 (to 1 decimal place) so it does not represent the majority of the data.",

        "A": "You are correct that Batch B's lightbulbs seem to last a longer length of time, but does a higher range mean they are more consistent?",
        "B": "A lower range implies more consistency as the lifespans are grouped closer together. A lower mean implies a shorter average life.",
        "C": "Batch A has a smaller range (300 hours) which means there is a smaller gap between the longest and shortest lifespan of its lightbulbs. Does this mean they are more consistent or less consistent than Batch B?",
        "D": "The mean tells us about the average properties of the lightbulbs, not their individual lifespans. A lightbulb in Batch A could last for 1850 hours, but if there are many with a shorter lifespan, the average will be lower than this."
