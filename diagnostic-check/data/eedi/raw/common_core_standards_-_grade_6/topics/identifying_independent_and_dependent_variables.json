        "A": "Not quite. Make sure you read both statements carefully. Remember the dependent variable is the variable whose value depends on and is affected by changes in the independent variable. Does the side length depend on the perimeter or does the perimeter depend on the side length?",
        "B": "Not quite. Make sure you read both statements carefully. Remember the independent variable is the variable whose value is chosen independently. Changing its value will change the quantity being calculated. Is this true for the side length? Will changing the side length, change the perimeter?",
        "C": "The independent variable is the variable whose value is chosen independently. Changing its value will change the quantity being calculated. The dependent variable is the variable whose value depends on and is affected by changes in the independent variable. In regards to the perimeter of a square, the side length can be chosen independently and the value of the perimeter depends on the value of the side length. Therefore, side length is the independent variable and perimeter is the dependent variable so both Tom and Katie are correct.",
        "D": "Not quite, at least one of the students is correct. Remember the independent variable is the variable you choose independently of the other variable and the dependent variable is the variable affected by changing the other variable. In this instance, does changing the value of s, change p? Does the value of p depend on the value of s?"
