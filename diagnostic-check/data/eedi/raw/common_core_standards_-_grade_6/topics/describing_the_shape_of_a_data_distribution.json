        "C": "There is a gap in the data as no student spent 10 or 11 hours on the project. Check the other statements carefully",
        "D": "There are 8 students who took longer than 7 hours to complete the project. How many students are there in total? You don't need to calculate an exact figure, but should be able to see from the diagram that most of the dots are NOT to the right of 7 hours"

        "C": "There is NOT a clear outlier in the data set as there is not one point which is far away from the main cluster. Therefore this is the only statement which does not match the data",
