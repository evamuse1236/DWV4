In this diagram, the base could be represented by the 12cm, but that would not make m the perpendicular height as they do not form a right angle.

        "C": "I think you were probably using the correct method, but may have made a calculation error. Can you check again?",
        "D": "We do actually have enough information here. Because the 8cm is perpendicular to the top length, it will also be perpendicular to the base length (as top and base are parallel). Can you remember how to use the perpendicular height to calculate the area of a parallelogram?"
