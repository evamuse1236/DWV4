        "B": "The recipe makes enough for 4 people, but we only want enough for 1 person. To get from 4 down to 1, we need to divide by 4. 60g of almonds divided by 4 gives us 15g of ground almonds.",
        "C": "I think you have subtracted 3g because we have subtracted 3 people, but if we need 60g of almonds for 4 people, we can't just need 1g per person. What do we have to divide 4 by to get down to 1?",
        "D": "I think you have found the right scale factor (4), but you have multiplied rather than divided. The recipe gives us the quantities for 4 people. Are we expecting to need more ground almonds for just 1 person?"
