If we want to express this information with an equals sign, we need to make the number of parts equal. This means multiplying 𝑎 by 7 and multiplying 𝑏 by 2 (to have 14 parts for each letter), and so the relationship can be expressed as 7𝑎 = 2𝑏",

Both ratios have 𝑏 in common, but this currently represents a different number of parts, being 1 part in 𝑎 : 𝑏 and 2 parts in 𝑏 : 𝑐. We can make b the same number of parts in both by multiplying the first ratio by 2 to give 𝑎 : 𝑏 = 6 : 2. Now that 𝑏 is 2 parts for both ratios, these can be combined to give 𝑎 : 𝑏 : 𝑐 = 6 : 2 : 5, and so the ratio of 𝑎 : 𝑐 = 6 : 5"
